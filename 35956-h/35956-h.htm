<p style='font-size:larger; text-align: center; margin-top: 2em;'>PREFACE</p>
<p>
No one person can fitly describe a neighborhood,
no matter how long known, how well
loved. Yet records of what is lovely and of
good report in a district should be treasured
and preserved, however imperfectly.
</p>
<p>
My father’s name, not mine, should rightly
be signed to these pages, for it is his intimate
knowledge of our countryside, loved and explored
with a boy’s ardor and a naturalist’s
insight since childhood, which they strive to
set down.
</p>
<p>
I have taken care to write almost wholly
of two or more generations ago, and of persons
who, with few exceptions, have now
passed out of this life; and I have in all cases
altered names, and shifted families from one
part of the county to another, to avoid possible
annoyance to surviving connections. It
has even seemed best in some cases—though
I have done so with reluctance—to change the
names of villages, of hills and streams, as
well.
</p>
<p>
Beyond this, I have striven only to record
faithfully the anecdotes and memories that
have come down to me. But no record, however
faithful, can be in any way adequate.
The rays will be refracted by the medium of
the writer’s personality; and the best that can
be done will be but a small mirrored fragment,
before the daily repeated miracle of
the living reality.

<h1>CHAPTER I—A NORTHERN COUNTRYSIDE</h1>
<p>
&#160;<br />
</p>
<p>
Our county lies in a northern State, in
the midst of one of those districts known
geographically as “regions of innumerable
lakes.” It is in good part wooded—hilly,
irregular country, not mountainous, but often
bold and marked in outline. Save for its
lakes, strangers might pass through it without
especial notice; but its broken hills have
a peculiar intimacy and lovableness, and to
us it is so beautiful that new wonder falls on
us year after year as we dwell in it.
</p>
<p>
There is a marked trend of the land. I
suppose the first landmark a bird would distinguish
in its flight would be our long,
round-shouldered ridges, running north and
south. Driving across country, either eastward
or westward, you go up and up in
leisurely rises, with plenty of fairly level
resting places between, up long calm shoulder
after shoulder, to the Height of Land. And
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4'></a>4</span>
there you take breath of wonder, for lo, before
you and below you, behold a whole new
countryside framed by new hills.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes the lower country thus revealed
is in its turn broken into lesser hills, or
moulded into noble rounding valleys. Sometimes
there are stretches of intervale or old
lake bottom, of real flat-land, a rare beauty
with us, on which the eyes rest with delight.
More often than not there is shining water,
lake or pond or stream. Sometimes this lower
valley country extends for miles before the
next range rises, so that your glance travels
restfully out over the wide spaces. Sometimes
it is little, like a cup.
</p>
<p>
As you get up towards the Height of Land
you come to what makes the returning New
Englander draw breath quickly, the pleasure
is so poignant: upland pastures dotted with
juniper and boulders, and broken by clumps
of balsam fir and spruce. Most fragrant, most
beloved places. Dicksonia fern grows thick
about the boulders. The pasturage is thin
June-grass, the color of beach sand, as it ripens,
and in August this is transformed to a queen’s
garden by the blossoming of blue asters and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5'></a>5</span>
the little <em>nemoralis</em> golden-rod, which grew
unnoticed all the earlier summer. Often
whole stretches of the slope are carpeted with
mayflowers and checkerberries, and as you
climb higher, and meet the wind from the
other side of the ridge, your foot crunches on
gray reindeer-moss.
</p>
<p>
Last week, before climbing a small bare-peaked
mountain, I turned aside to explore a
path which led through a field of scattered
balsam firs, with lady-fern growing thick
about their feet. A little further on, the firs
were assembled in groups and clumps, and
then group was joined to group. The valley
grew deeper and darker, and still the same
small path led on, till I found myself in the
tallest and most solemn wood of firs that I have
ever seen. They were sixty feet high, needle-pointed,
black, and they filled the long hollow
between the hills, like a dark river.
</p>
<p>
The woods alternate with fields to clothe
the hills and intervales and valleys, and make
a constant and lovely variety over the landscape.
Sometimes they seem a shore instead
of a river. They jut out into the meadowland,
in capes and promontories, and stand
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6'></a>6</span>
in little islands, clustered round an outcropping
ledge or a boulder too big to be removed.
You are confronted everywhere with
this meeting of the natural and indented shore
of the woods, close, feathery, impenetrable,
with the bays and inlets of field and pasture
and meadow. The jutting portions are apt
to be made more sharp and marked by the
most striking part of our growth, the evergreens.
There they grow, white pine and
red pine, black spruce, hemlock, and balsam
fir, in lovely sisterhood. Their needles shine
in the sun. They taper perfectly, finished at
every point, clean, dry, and resinous; and the
fragrance distilled from them by our crystal
air is as surely the very breath of New England
as that of the Spice Islands is the breath
of the East.
</p>
<p>
Our soil is often spoken of as barren, but
this is only where it has been neglected. Hay
and apples give us abundant crops; indeed our
apples have made a name at home and
abroad. Potatoes also give us a very fine
yield, and a great part of the State is rich
in lumber. When it is left to itself, the
land reverts to wave after wave of luxuriant
pine forest. Forty miles east of us they are
cutting out masts again where the <em>Constitution’s</em>
masts were cut.
</p>

<span class='caption'>THE WOODS JUT OUT IN ISLANDS ROUND AN OUTCROPPING LEDGE</span>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7'></a>7</span></div>
<p>
The apple orchards are scattered over the
slopes. In the more upland places, sheep are
kept, and the sheep-pastures are often
hillside orchards of tall sugar maples.
We have neat fields of oats and barley, more
or less scattered, and once in a while a buckwheat
patch, while every farm has a good
cornfield, beans, pumpkins, and potatoes, besides
“the woman’s” little patch of “garden
truck.” A good many bees are kept, in
colonies of gray hives under the apple
trees.
</p>
<p>
The people who live on the farms are, I
suppose, much like farm people everywhere.
“Folks are folks”; yet, after being much with
them, certain qualities impress themselves
upon one’s notice as characteristic; they have
a dry sense of humor, and quaint and whimsical
ways of expressing it, and with this, a
refinement of thought and speech that is almost
fastidious; a fine reticence about the
physical aspects of life such as is only found,
I believe, in a strong race, a people drawing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8'></a>8</span>
their vigor from deep and untainted springs.
I often wonder whether there is another
place in the world where women are sheltered
from any possible coarseness of expression
with such considerate delicacy as they
find among the rough men on a New England
farm.
</p>
<p>
The life is so hard, the hours so necessarily
long, in our harsh climate, that small-natured
persons too often become little
more than machines. They get through their
work, and they save every penny they can;
and that is all. The Granges, however, are
increasing a pleasant and wholesome social
element which is beyond price, and all winter
you meet sleighs full of rosy-cheeked families,
driving to the Hall for Grange Meeting, or
Sunday Meeting, or for the weekly dance.
</p>
<p>
Many of the farm people are large-minded
enough to do their work well, and still keep
above and on top of it; and some of these
stand up in a sort of splendor. Their fibres
have been seasoned in a life that calls for
all a man’s powers. Their grave kind faces
show that, living all their lives in one place,
they have taken the longest of all journeys,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9'></a>9</span>
and traveled deep into the un-map-able country
of Life. I do not know how to write
fittingly of some of these older farm people;
wise enough to be simple, and deep-rooted as
the trees that grow round them; so strong
and attuned to their work that the burdens
of others grow light in their presence, and
life takes on its right and happier proportions
when one is with them.
</p>
<p>
If the first impression of our country is
its uniformity, the second and amazing one
is its surprises, its secret places. The long
ridges accentuate themselves suddenly into
sharp slopes and steep cup-shaped valleys,
covered with sweet-fern and juniper. The
wooded hills are often full of hidden cliffs
(rich gardens in themselves, they are so
deep in ferns and moss), and quick brooks run
through them, so that you are never long
without the talk of one to keep you company.
There are rocky glens, where you meet cold,
sweet air, the ceaseless comforting of a
waterfall, and moss on moss, to velvet depths
of green.
</p>
<p>
The ridges rise and slope and rise again
with general likeness, but two of them open
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10'></a>10</span>
amazingly to disclose the wide blue surface of
our great River. We are rich in rivers, and
never have to journey far to reach one, but
I never can get quite used to the surprise of
coming among the hills on this broad strong
full-running stream, with gulls circling
over it.
</p>
<p>
One thing sets us apart from other regions:
our wonderful lakes. They lie all around us,
so that from every hill-top you see their
shining and gleaming. It is as if the worn
mirror of the glacier had been splintered into
a thousand shining fragments, and the common
saying is that our State is more than
half water. They are so many that we call
them <em>ponds</em>, not lakes, whether they are two
miles long, or ten, or twenty.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor"><sup>[1]</sup></a> I have counted
over nine hundred on the State map, and then
given up counting. No one person could ever
know them all; there still would be new “Lost
Ponds” and “New Found Lakes.”
</p>
<p>
The greater part of them lie in the unbroken
woods, but countless numbers are in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11'></a>11</span>
open farming country. They run from great
sunlit sheets with many islands to the most
perfect tiny hidden forest jewels, places
utterly lonely and apart, mirroring only the
depths of the green woods.
</p>
<p>
Each “pond,” large or little, is a world in itself.
You can almost believe that the moon
looks down on each with different radiance,
that the south wind has a special fragrance
as it blows across each; and each one has
some peculiar, intimate beauty; deep bays,
lovely and secluded channels between wooded
islands, or small curved beaches which shine
between dark headlands, lit up now and then
by a camp fire.
</p>
<p>
Hill after hill, round-shouldered ridge after
ridge; low nearer the salt water, increasing
very gradually in height till they form the
wild amphitheatre of blue peaks in the northern
part of the State; partly farming country,
and greater part wooded; this is our countryside,
and across it and in and out of the
forests its countless lovely lakes shine and its
great rivers thread their tranquil way to the
sea.
</p>
<hr class='fnsep' />
<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1" id="Footnote_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a>
The legal distinction in our State is not between ponds and lakes, but between ponds and “Great Ponds.” All land-locked waters over ten acres in area are Great Ponds; in which the public have rights of fishing, ice-cutting, etc.

<h1>CHAPTER II—THE RIVER</h1>
<p>
&#160;<br />
</p>
<p>
Our river is one of the pair of kingly
streams which traverse almost our entire State
from north to south. The first twenty-five
miles of its course, after leaving the great
lake which it drains, is a tearing rapid between
rocky walls: then follows perhaps a
hundred miles of alternating falls and “dead
water,” the falls being now fast taken up
as water powers. It has eleven hundred feet
to fall to reach the sea, and it does most of
this in its first thirty miles.
</p>
<p>
The river’s course through part of our
county is marked by a noticeable geological
formation. For a space of fifteen miles, the
greater and lesser tributary streams have
broken their way down through the western
ridge of the river valley in a succession of
small chasms that are so many true mountain
defiles in little. They have the sharp descents
and extreme variety of slopes and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13'></a>13</span>
counter-slopes, though with walls never more
than a hundred and fifty feet high.
</p>
<p>
There are forty or fifty of these ravines,
some nourishing strong brooks, some a mere
trickle, or a stream of green marsh and
ferns where water once ran. Acushticook,
which threads the largest, is really a river, and
Rollingdam, Bombahook, and Worromontogus
are all powerful streams. Rollingdam
follows a very private course, hidden in deep
mossy woods for several miles. The ravine
presently deepens and becomes more marked,
descending in abrupt slopes, then narrows to
a gorge, the rocky sides of which are covered
with moss and ferns, nourished by spray.
The brook runs through it in two or three
short cascades, and falls sheer and white to a
pool, twelve feet below.
</p>
<p>
Below our Town, the river sweeps on,
steadily wider and nobler in expanse, till it
reaches the place where five other rivers pour
their streams into its waters, and it broadens
into the sheet of Merrymeeting Bay, three
miles from shore to shore.
</p>
<p>
Below the bay the channel narrows almost
to a gorge. The sides are steep and rocky,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14'></a>14</span>
crowned with black growth of fir and
spruce, and through this space the swollen
waters pour in great force. There are strong
tide races, in which the river steamers reel and
tremble, and below this there begins a perfect
labyrinth of channels, some mere backwaters,
some leading through intricate passages
among a hundred fairy islands. There are
cliffs, moss and fern-grown, and countless
dark headlands. The islands are heavily
wooded with characteristic evergreen growth,
dense, fragrant, of a rich color, and they are
ringed with cream-white granite above the
sea-weed, where the blue water circles them.—And
so down, till the first break of blue
sea shows between the spruces.
</p>
<p>
We never feel cut off, or too far inland,
having our river. The actual sea fog reaches
us on a south wind, salt to the lips. Gulls
come up all the way from the sea, and save
for the winter months, there is hardly a day
when you do not see four or five of them
wheeling and circling; while twice or thrice
in a lifetime a gale brings us Mother Carey’s
chickens, scudding low, or else worn out and
resting after the storm.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15'></a>15</span>
</p>
<p>
The river sleeps all winter under its white
covering, but great cracks go ringing and resounding
up stream as the tide makes or
ebbs, leaping half a mile to a note, to tell
of the life that is pulsing beneath; and before
the snow comes, you can watch, through
the black ice, the drift stuff move quietly
beneath your feet with the tide as you skate.
I have read fine print through two feet of
ice, from a bit of newspaper carried along
below by the current. One winter a dovekie
lived for three weeks by a small open space
made by the eddy near some ledges; then a
hard freeze came, and the poor thing broke its
neck, diving at the round black space of ice
which looked scarcely different from the same
space of open water.
</p>
<p>
The river lies frozen for at least four
months. The ice weakens with the March
thaws and rains. Then comes a night in
April when the forces which move the mountains
are at work, and in the morning, lo,
the chains are broken. The great stream
runs swift and brown and the ice cakes
crowd and jostle each other as they spin
past.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16'></a>16</span>
</p>
<p>
The river traffic goes steadily on through
our three open seasons, and with it a little
of the longer perspective of all sea-faring
life comes to us, and off-sets the day-in-day-out
of the town’s shop and factory routine.
</p>
<p>
Our southern lumber is brought us by
handsome three and four-masted schooners,
which take northern lumber and ice on the
return voyage. The other day two schooners,
on their maiden voyage, white and trim as
yachts, were at the lumber wharf, the <em>Break
of Day</em> and the <em>Herald of the Morning</em>.
</p>
<p>
Our coal comes in the usual long ugly
barges. One or two small excursion steamers
connect us with the nearer coast towns, forty
miles distant, and every day all summer, the
one large passenger steamer which connects
us with the big coast cities, comes to or from
our town. She takes her tranquil way between
the river hills, not without majesty,
while the water draws back from the shores
as she passes and the high banks reverberate
to the peaceful thunder of her paddles. Like
other river towns, we have now a fleet of
motor boats, in use for pleasure and small
fishing.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17'></a>17</span>
</p>
<p>
Traffic on the river shrank immensely with
the forming of the Ice Trust, which holds
our ice-fields now only as a reserve. We see
three or four tall schooners at a time now,
where we used to count the riding lights of a
dozen at anchor in the channel.
</p>
<p>
The greater part of our fleet of tugs is scattered.
The <em>Resolute</em> and <em>Adelia</em>,—dear me,
even their names are like old friends—the
<em>Clara Clarita</em>, the <em>City of Lynn</em>, the <em>Knickerbocker</em>,
and the trim smart twin tugs, <em>Charlie
Lawrence</em> and <em>Stella</em>, have gone to other
waters. The <em>Ice-King</em> plies now in the coast-wise
trade. Our lessened river work is done
by the <em>Seguin</em>, a large and handsome boat, the
<em>Ariel</em>, a T-wharf tug from Boston, and the
<em>Sarah J. Green</em>, an ugly boat with a smokestack
too tall for her.
</p>
<p>
The Government boat comes up in late April,
while the river is still very rapid, brown and
swirling after the spring freshet, and sets the
channel buoys. We always thrill a little at
her unwonted, sea-sounding whistle. She
comes again in November, takes up the buoys,
and carries them to some strange buoy paddock
in one of the winter harbors, where hundreds
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18'></a>18</span>
and hundreds of them are stacked and repainted.
The names of the revenue cutters in
this service are prettily chosen, the <em>Lilac</em>,
<em>Geranium</em>, etc.
</p>
<p>
Before the days of tugs, schooners and
larger vessels sailed up and down the thirty-odd
navigable miles of our river under their
own canvas, and the traffic to and from Atlantic
ports was carried on by packets: brigs,
schooners, and topsail schooners. One of the
captains has told me that, seventy-five years
ago, on his first voyage, it took his brig seven
days to beat to the mouth of the river, a
passage now made in six hours. It must
have been extremely difficult piloting. The
channel is narrow in many places, though the
river itself is so wide. There are sand-bars,
mud-flats, and ledges.
</p>
<p>
In my Father’s childhood a curious, indeed
a unique type of vessel, known as a
Waterville Sloop, plied between what was
then (before the building of the dams), the
head of navigation, twenty-six miles above
us, and Boston, taking lumber and hay. They
carried one square-rigged mast, and sailed
with lee-boards, like the Dutch galliots, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19'></a>19</span>
were in fact a survival of the square-rigged
sloops of old time, immortal in the memories
of the glorious Sloops of War, and in Turner’s
pictures.
</p>
<p>
Once in a while you still see “pinkies,”
which were once so common: small schooner-rigged
vessels with a “pink” (probably
originally a <em>pinked</em>) stern, <em>i.e.</em>, a stern rising
to a point, with a crotch to rest the boom in.
</p>
<p>
Scows are rarer than they used to be, but
they still carry on their humble, casual lumber
and hay business, sailing up with the flood-tide,
and tying up for the ebb. They are
sloop-rigged, quite smart-looking under sail,
and sail with lee-boards, like the Waterville
Sloops.
</p>
<p>
The Lobster Smack, a tiny two-masted
schooner, not more than thirty feet long,
comes once a week in the season, and we buy
our lobsters on the wharf and carry them
home all sprawling, and are delighted when
we get a little sea-weed with them.
</p>
<p>
The laborers of the river are the dredges,
pile-drivers, and their kind. They must see
to the journeyman’s work that keeps the
river’s traffic unhampered. They drive piers
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20'></a>20</span>
and jetties and dredge out sand-bars. They
go and come, unnoticed by smarter vessels,
laden heavily with broken stone, sand, or
gravel. They are dingy powerful boats, fitted
with a derrick and hoist or other machinery.
They carry big rope buffers at bow and sides,
and in spite of this their bulwarks are splintered
and scarred where they have been
jammed against wharves and knocked about.
There is no fresh paint or bright brass about
them, they are grimy citizens, but are all
strong and seaworthy. Sometimes the Captain
is also owner; sometimes one man owns
a whole little fleet, of two dredges, say, and a
small tug, named perhaps after wife and
daughters, as in one case I know, the <em>Nellie</em>,
<em>Sophia</em>, and <em>Doris</em>. This is the family venture,
followed with as much anxious pride in
“our Vessels” as if the fleet were Cunarders.
</p>
<p>
One day what should come up the river
but a white schooner, tapering and tall, and
glistening with new masts and cordage, bearing
a fairy cargo of shells and corals. The
rare shells, some of them costly museum
pieces, were to be sold to collectors, if any
were to be found along our northern harbors,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21'></a>21</span>
while others, as beautiful as flowers or sunset
clouds, the children might have for a few
pennies.
</p>
<p>
The Captain was a young Spaniard, very
dark, and as handsome, grave, and simple in
bearing, as a Spanish Captain should be.
His men seemed to adore him, and to obey
the turn of his eyelashes. They all gave us
a charming welcome, especially to the children.
It was a leisurely and pleasant little
venture. I do not know whether it brought
in profit, but all the town flocked to the
schooner, day after day, for the week that
she stayed with us.
</p>
<p>
The rafts come down the river when they
please. They look about as easy to manœuvre
as an ice-house, but the flannel-shirted lumbermen
who operate them, two to a raft,
seem unconcerned, and scull away at their long
“sweeps,” in the apparently hopeless task
of keeping their clumsy craft off the shallows.
With the breaking up of the ice, stray
logs, escaped from the holding booms, come
down stream. The moment the ice-cakes are
out of the river, even before, you begin to
notice shabby old row-boats tied up and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22'></a>22</span>
waiting at the mouth of every stream and
“guzzle”; and as soon as a log whirls down
amongst the confusion of ice, you will see
boats put out, perhaps with a couple of boys,
or else some old humped-up fellow, in a coat
green with age, rowing cross-handed, nosing
out like an old pickerel watching for minnows.
The logs that are missed drift about
till they are water-logged, when they sink
little by little, and at last become what are
known as “tide-waiters,” or “tide-rollers,”
<em>i.e.</em> snags drifting above, or resting partly on,
the bottom, a menace to vessels.
</p>
<p>
There are holding booms at different turns
of the river, with odd shabby little house-boats
for the rafts-men moored beside them; and
what are these called but <em>gundalows</em>, an old,
old “Down-east” corruption of <em>gondola</em>;
whether in derision, or in ignorance, is
not now known. Sometimes they are fitted
up with some coziness, perhaps with
white curtains and a little fresh paint,
and I have even seen geraniums at their
windows.
</p>
<p>
Another brand-new schooner, the <em>William
D’Arcy</em>, tied up at our lumber wharf this last
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23'></a>23</span>
spring, and lay there for nearly a week. We
all went on board her. She lay at the sheltered
side of the wharf, out of the cold wind,
and the sun poured down on her. The smell
of salt and cordage was so strong that you
could almost feel the lift of her bows to the
swell, but there she lay, as quiet as if she had
never lifted to a wave at all. The men were at
work at various jobs; no one was in a hurry;
it plainly made no difference whether they
were two days at the wharf or ten.
</p>
<p>
The bulwarks and outside fittings, anchors,
hawsers, and hawse-holes, seemed wonderfully
large to our landsman eyes, and the inside
fittings, lockers, etc., as wonderfully small
and compact. The enormous masts were of
new yellow Oregon pine.
</p>
<p>
The Captain welcomed us hospitably, and
took us down into his cabin, which was fitted
with shelves, lockers, and cupboards, neat and
compact, all brand-new and shining with varnish.
There was a shelf of books, the table
had a red cover and reading lamp, and the
wife’s work-basket stood on it, with some
mending. She had gone “upstreet” for her
marketing.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24'></a>24</span>
</p>
<p>
“Oh,” said one of us, “it looks so homelike
and cozy!”
</p>
<p>
The Captain looked round it complacently,
but with remembering eyes that spoke of
many things. He had been cruising all
winter.
</p>
<p>
“It looks so to you,” he said, “but often
it ain’t.”

<h1>CHAPTER III—THE BANKS OF THE RIVER</h1>
<p>
&#160;<br />
</p>
<p>
The river-bank boys pick up, as easily as
they breathe, knowledge as miscellaneous as
the drift piled on the shores. They know all
the shoals and principal eddies, without the
aid of buoys. They know the ways and
seasons of the different fish. They learn to
recognize the owner’s marks on the logs, and
they know the times and ways of all the
humbler as well as the larger river craft, the
scows and smacks, and the “gundalows”
which spend mysterious month after month
hauled up among the sedges at the mouths
of the streams. Their own row-boats are
heavy, square at both ends, and clumsy to
row, but as I have said, they are out in them
in the spring before the floating ice is out of
the river, rescuing logs and fragments of lumber
from between the ice-cakes.
</p>
<p>
There is a good deal to the business of
picking up logs. The price for returning
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26'></a>26</span>
“strays” to the right owners is ten cents a
log (the rate increasing as you go down
stream), and a good many can be towed at
once by a small boat. The price per log rises
to twenty-five cents, near the sea. In times
of high freshet, the up-river booms often
break, and then there is a tremendous to-do at
the mouth of the river: men, women, and
children, all who can handle or half-handle a
dory, are at work at log-rescuing. Incoming
ships have found the surface of the ocean
brown with logs at these times, and have a
great work to get through them.
</p>
<p>
Logs that have lost their marks are called
“scalawags,” and these are sold for the benefit
of the log-driving company. Hollow-hearted
<em>pine</em> logs are known by the curious
term “concussy,” or “conquassy.” To show
the immense change in the prices of lumber,
the best pine lumber, which in 1870 was
worth ten dollars a thousand feet, is now one
hundred dollars a thousand.
</p>
<p>
Now and then a boy takes to the river so
strongly that he makes his life work out of
its teachings. The captains and engineers
of most of our river and harbor steamers,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27'></a>27</span>
and of bigger craft, too, began life as riverbank
boys. Some of them take to fishing in
earnest, some become lumbermen, or go into
the Coast-Survey service, or the Rivers and
Harbors; and the winter work on the ice
leads to an interesting life for a good many
others. Once in a while one of these boys goes
far from home. We have had word of one and
another, serving as pilot or engineer in Japanese,
Brazilian, and East Indian waters.
</p>
<p>
The three Tucker brothers, Joel, Reuel, and
Amos, three finely-built men, all worked up to
be registered pilots. Joel, the eldest, was
pilot of an ocean-going steamer all his life.
He grew very stout, and had a fine nautical
presence, in blue cloth and brass buttons.
Reuel was lazy. He never went higher than
small raft-towing tugs, and he often gave
up his work and loafed about, fishing. He
was the man who swam five miles down
river, and stopped then because he was
bored, not because he was tired. Amos, the
finest of them, a gallant looking fellow, with
very bright blue eyes, was a pilot for a good
many years, and then a foreman in the ice
business. He was a man of such shining
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28'></a>28</span>
kindness that he was always up to the handle
in work in the heart of his town, as
selectman, honorary and volunteer overseer of
the poor, and helper-out in general. In a
case of all-night nursing, in a poor family,
where a man’s strength was needed, Amos
was on hand, rubbing his eyes, but watchful
and ready. Once, when a neighbor’s wife
had to be taken to the Insane Hospital, Amos
undertook the sad task, and his gentleness
made it just bearable. Parents looked to
him for help in the care of a bad or unruly
boy.
</p>
<p>
Then there were the Tracys, who ran—and
still run—a queer little ferry at Jonestown,
“according to seasons.” When the
ice begins to break up they row the passengers
across, somehow, in a heavy flat-boat,
between the ice cakes. Their regular boat,
in which they embark wagons and even a
motor, is a large scow pulled across by a
chain, with a sail to help when the wind
serves. The Tracys’ ferry is, I think, unique
for one regulation; man and wife go as one
fare.
</p>
<p>
Some of the river bank people are mere
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29'></a>29</span>
squatters. <em>The</em> squatter, as we called him, <em>par
excellence</em>, pulled the logs and bits for his
dwelling actually out of the river, as a muskrat
collects bits of drift for his house. He
was a Frenchman, and such a house as he
built! Part tar-paper, part bark, part clay
bank, the rest logs, barrel-staves, and a few
railroad sleepers. But there he lived, on a
tiny level plot under the railroad bank, so
near the river that each spring freshet threatened
entire destruction. He made or acquired
a boat that matched his house, and presently
he brought not only his wife and children,
but two brothers and an old mother to live
with him. The women contrived some tiny
garden patches on the slopes of the river
bank, and with the rich silt of the stream
these throve wonderfully. The men fished,
and “odd-jobbed” about.
</p>
<p>
Then came the Great Freshet. Dear me!
shall we ever forget it? We woke one March
night to hear every bell in town ringing,
while a long ominous whistle repeated the
terrifying signal of the freshet alarm.
</p>
<p>
There was a confusion of sounds from the
river, wild crashings and grindings and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30'></a>30</span>
thunders, as the ice broke up in its full
strength, with a noise almost like cannon.
</p>
<p>
The water rose and rose. By daybreak it
was up to the shop-counters in the street,
and people paddled in and out of the shops
in canoes, rescuing their goods. The ice-cakes
were piled ten feet high on our unfortunate
railroad. Then a great holding-boom
broke, a mile up river. A twenty-foot
wall of logs swept round the bend, and the
watchers on the roofs and raised platforms
saw it splinter and carry out the Town
Bridge as if it had been kindlings.
</p>
<p>
Sheds and boat-houses and wharfing were
whirled past all day in the tumble of ice
cakes. Like other people in danger, the
Squatter carried out his gipsy household
goods, and moved up town with his family;
all but the old French mother. She would
not be moved, but sat in the middle of the
road on a backless chair, watching her dwelling.
She could have done nothing to save
it, but nothing could tear her away. The
rain poured all that day and the next. Some
one lent her a big broken umbrella, and there
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31'></a>31</span>
she sat. I could think of nothing but a forlorn
old eaves swallow, watching the place
where her mud dwelling was being torn
off.
</p>
<p>
By some miracle of the eddy, however, the
house stayed intact; but soon after they all
moved away, to safer, and, I believe, more
comfortable quarters.
</p>
<p>
The Lamont family lived a mile north of
the Town. They had a ramshackle house and
barn, in a bit of open meadow by the mouth
of one of the brooks. You might say of the
Lamonts that they were so steeped in river
mud that every bone of them was lazy and
easy and slack. There were the father and
mother, and seven children. They were as
unkempt and ragged as could be, but they
always seemed cheerful and smiling, and the
younger children were fat as little dumplings.
The three eldest were shambling young men;
they and the father seemed perfectly content
with a little fishing and odd-jobbing,
and now and then one of them took a turn
as deck-hand or stevedore, or—as a last
resort—as farm-hand. The girls and the
mother dug and sold dandelion greens, dock,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32'></a>32</span>
and thoroughwort and other old-fashioned
simples.
</p>
<p>
None of them had ever gone to school a
day beyond the time required by law, and
they kept the truant officer busy at that;
then all of a sudden the youngest and fattest
Lamont, whose incongruous name was Hernaldo,
appeared at the High School. He
was an imperturbable child, and quite dull,
but he worked with a cheerful slow patience.
He only held on for a year, but no one had
imagined he could keep on for so long, and
he did not do badly.
</p>
<p>
The elders died before the younger children
were quite grown, and the family scattered;
one night, after it had been empty a
year or two, the ramshackle house burned,
leaving the barn standing.
</p>
<p>
One morning about ten years afterwards a
radiant being appeared at the High School,
a fat young man in frock coat and tall hat,
who came forward and shook hands effusively.
It was Hernaldo Lamont! He was
now <em>chef</em>, it appeared, at one of the great
California hotels through the winters, and in
Vancouver in summer, at a very large salary.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33'></a>33</span>
A pretty girl, charmingly dressed, whom he
introduced as his wife, waited modestly at the
door.
</p>
<p>
His clothes were quite wonderful. He was
shining with soap and with fashion, and so
full of warmth and of pleasure. He brought
out colored photographs of his two fat little
children, told of his staff and his patrons,
beamed upon everyone, and showed his pretty
wife all about our plain High School, admiring
and reverent. I think that if it had
been Oxford he could not have been prouder,
and indeed Oxford could never be to the
average student a place of higher achievement
than High School to a Lamont!
</p>
<p>
He was so simple and kindly that I believe
he would have taken his wife to the
Lamont shanty as happily. The Lamont
barn is still standing, grown up with tall
nettles and dandelions. A farmer uses it for
his extra hay, mowed in the low rich patches
of river meadow. Tramps sleep in the hay,
and quantities of barn-swallows flash in and
out of the empty windows.
</p>
<p>
Long ago our River was one of the great
salmon streams of the country. In my
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34'></a>34</span>
great grandfather’s time agreements between
apprentices and servants, and their employers,
held the stipulation that the employees
should not have to eat salmon <em>above
five times in the week</em>; and the fish were used
for fertilizing the fields. There are none now
at all, and the sturgeon fishing, which in my
father’s boyhood used to make summer nights
on the River a time of torchlit adventure, is
over too, though still late on a summer
afternoon you may see now and then a
silver flash, and hear a crash, as the huge
creature jumps; and only last week two sturgeon
of over eight hundred pounds weight
each were brought in right near the Town
Bridge. They were caught by two hard-working
lads, and brought them a little fortune,
for they were sold in New York for
over $250.
</p>
<p>
Not even the flight of the birds from the
south, unbelievable in wonder as this is, is
more miraculous than the run of the fish,
from the vast spaces of ocean up all our
fresh-water streams for hundreds of miles.
Their bright thousands find their way unerringly,
up into the heart of the country.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35'></a>35</span>
No one knows whence they come, and save
for an occasional straggler, no one has ever
taken salmon or shad or ale-wife in deep
water. We know their passage up-stream,
but no one knows when they take their way
down again.
</p>
<p>
The smelts run up, when winter is still at
its height. They are caught through holes
in the ice. The men build huts of boards or
of boughs, each round his own smelt hole.
They build a fire on the ice, or have a kerosene
lantern or lamp, and fish thus all day in
fair comfort. They catch smelts by thousands,
so that our town’s people, who can
eat them not two hours out of the water, are
spoiled for the smelts which are called fresh
in cities. Tom-cod come up a little ahead
of the smelts.
</p>
<p>
Soon after the ice goes out, while the water
is still very rapid and turgid, the alewives
run up, and they are as good eating as smelts,
though too full of bones. They are smoked
slightly, but not salted. About this time, too,
the smaller boys begin catching yellow-perch
at the mouths of the brooks. These, and tom-cod,
are not thought worth putting on the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36'></a>36</span>
market, but they are crisp little fish, and a
string of them, thirteen for twelve cents,
makes a good supper.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor"><sup>[2]</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Suckers also come with the opening of
the brooks. The discovery has been made
lately, that these fish, which New Englanders
despise (quite wrongly, for if well cooked
they are firm and good), are prized by the
Jewish population of some of the bigger
cities, and bring a good price. A ton and a
half of suckers were shipped from our river
this season.
</p>
<p>
Our royal fish are the shad, which arrive in
the middle of May, when the woods are all
blossoming. The May river is full of their
great silvery squadrons. They are caught at
night, in drift nets, by hundreds. Most of
them are shipped away, but our Town must
and does eat as many as possible. One
family, who know what they like, practically
abjure all other solid food for the shad
season!
</p>
<p>
Of all our fish, eels are the most mysterious;
for they go <em>down</em> river to the ocean
(out of the fresh water streams and lakes)
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37'></a>37</span>
to spawn, instead of coming up. No one
knows what mysterious depths they penetrate,
but it is said that baby eels are found
in one and two thousand fathoms of water.
By midsummer they are about six inches
long, and are running home up the brooks.
They wriggle up waterfalls and scale the
sheer faces of dams. They stay three or
four years in their inland home, growing to
full size, and in September, the fat grown-up
eels run down the streams again, to spawn
in the sea. This is the time when they are
caught at dams and in mill streams, and
shipped to the big cities in quantities. Our
biggest paper mill, not long ago, was shut
down entirely because of the eels, which got
in through the flumes by hundreds, and
stopped the water wheels.
</p>
<p>
The taking of the Acushticook eels is now
a regular industry, and this came about rather
sadly. Stephen Mitchell, the millwright of
the Acushticook paper mill, was a fine man,
with a turn for inventing. His ideas were
sound and a good many of his mechanical
devices turned out excellently. He became
interested in explosives, and worked for a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38'></a>38</span>
long time at a new method for capping torpedoes.
He had been warned time and again,
and such an intelligent man must have realized
perfectly the danger of work with explosive
materials, but one day an accident
happened. There was an explosion which
took not only both hands, but his eyes.
</p>
<p>
I think everyone in the town felt sickened
by the accident, and by the prospect of helpless
invalidism ahead of a fine active man.
But Stephen, as soon as his wounds healed,
began looking for something to do.
</p>
<p>
The Acushticook eels had always been
fished for in a desultory fashion, and Stephen
cast about for a way to make the fishing
amount to more. The mill owners did all in
their power to help him. They gladly gave
him the sole right of the use of the stream,
and helped him in building his dam. He had
also a grant from the Legislature. He hired
good workers, and for many years he and
his wife, who was a master hand, lived
happily and successfully on their fishery.
Sometimes two tons of eels were shipped in
the course of the autumn.
</p>
<p>
Stephen always was cheerful. He could
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39'></a>39</span>
see enough difference between light and darkness
to find his way about town, and he was
so quick to recognize voices that you forgot
his blindness. He kept among people a great
deal, and was an animated talker at town
gatherings. He was an opinionated man, but
a fine and upright one. After his death his
widow kept on with the fishery, and she still
runs it with profit.

<h1>CHAPTER IV.—THE CAPTAINS</h1>
<p>
&#160;<br />
</p>
<p>
You would never think now that tall Indiamen
were once built here in our town, but
they were, and sailed hence round the world
away, and we too boasted our wharves, with
the once-familiar notice:
</p>
<p>
“All ships required to cock-a-bill their
yards before lying at this dock.”
</p>
<p>
The last ship built in the town was the
<em>Valley Forge</em>, launched about 1860; the last
built at Bowman’s Point, two miles above,
was the <em>Two Brothers</em>. The <em>Valley Forge</em> for
ten whole years was never out of Eastern
waters, plying between China and Sumatra,
and the seaports of the Inland Sea.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Peter Simons, one of our early magnates,
and “ship’s husband,” of many vessels
(kind, merry, handsome Mr. Peter, he never
was husband to anyone but his ships), took
a treasure voyage to the Spanish Main once,
and brought home a moderate sized treasure,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41'></a>41</span>
some of the doubloons of which are preserved
in his family to this day.
</p>
<p>
Ship-building was the chief industry of the
place. There were four principal ship-yards.
The skippers as well as the lumber came from
close at hand. It seems a wonderful thing,
in these stay-at-home times, that keen young
lads from the farms could have been, at
twenty-one, in command of full-rigged ships,
fearlessly making their way, in prosperous
trade, to places that might as well be in
Mars, for all most of us know of them to-day:
but Java and the Spice Islands, Shanghai,
Tasmania, and the Moluccas were household
words in those days, and you still hear a
sentence now and then which shows the one-time
familiarity of ways which have passed
from our knowledge.
</p>
<p>
The portraits at the house of Captain
George Annable, the last of our clipper-ship
captains, were painted in Antwerp. So were
those (very queer ones), at Captain Charles
Aiken’s, and at Captain Andrews’. It
appears now in talk with Captain Annable
that <em>of course</em> they were painted at Antwerp,
for that was where the American skippers
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42'></a>42</span>
as a rule wintered. Living there was better
and cheaper for them and their families than
at any other foreign port. It became the custom
to winter at Antwerp, and there grew
to be an American society there.
</p>
<p>
Captain Annable has crossed the Atlantic
sixty-three times, sailing clipper mail-ships.
</p>
<p>
The Captains are nearly all gone now. Little
trace of the ship-yards remains, and even
the wharves from which the Indiamen sailed
have rotted, and been replaced by the lumber
and coal wharves of to-day; but all through
the countryside you come on touches of the
shipping days, and of the East, as startling
as a sudden fragrance of sandalwood in some
old cabinet. At one house I know there is a
collection of butterflies and moths of the
Far East, with two cream-colored Atlas
moths eight inches from tip to tip. At another
there is a set of rice-paper paintings
of the orders of the Japanese nobility and
gentry, with full insignia of state robes, which
ought to be in a museum; and the parlor of
a third neighbor, the gracious widow of a sea-captain,
has, besides carved teak furniture and
Chinese embroideries, a set of carved ivory
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43'></a>43</span>
chessmen fit for a palace. The king and
queen stand over eight inches high. The
castles are true elephant-and-castles, and the
pawns are tiny mounted and turbaned warriors,
brandishing scimitars. The figures
stand on carved open-work balls-within-balls,
four deep—“Laborious Orient ivory, sphere
in sphere”—as delicate as frost-work. This
set was bought in Shanghai, when the foreign
compound still had its guard of soldiers, and
the Chinese thronged the doorways to stare
at the “white devils.”
</p>
<p>
The great gold-figured lacquer cabinet, the
pride of one of our statelier houses, was
brought from China a hundred years ago, by
a young Captain Jameson, who was coming
home for his wedding. He sailed again with
his bride immediately after the marriage,
and their ship never was heard of. The
cabinet was sold, and then sold again, till
it finally reached the setting which fits it so
well.
</p>
<p>
You find lacquered Indian teapoys,
Eastern porcelains, shells and corals from all
round the world far out in scattered farmhouses;
and farm-hands are still summoned to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44'></a>44</span>
meals by a blast on a conch-shell, a queer
note, not unlike the belling of an elk.
</p>
<p>
Beside the actual china and embroideries
and carvings, something of the character bred
in the seafaring days has spread, like nourishing
silt, through our countryside. The Captains
were grave, quiet men. They had power
of command, and keenness in emergency.
Contact with many people of many nations
quickened their perceptions and gave them
charming manners; but more than this, there
was something large-minded and tranquil
about them. All their lives they had to deal
with an element stronger than themselves. The
next day’s work could never be planned or
calculated on, and something of the detached
quality which comes from dealing with the
sea, a long and simple perspective towards
human affairs, became part of them.
</p>
<p>
An expression of married life, so beautiful
that I can never forget it, came from the
lips of the widow of one of our sea-captains,
a little old lady, now over eighty, who lives
alone in a tiny brick cottage (where she has
accomplished the almost unique feat of making
English ivy flourish in our sub-arctic
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45'></a>45</span>
climate). She wears a wonderful cap, and
fills her house with quilts and cushions
of silk patch-work which would make a
kaleidoscope blink. I had an errand to her
about a poorer neighbor, one Thanksgiving
time. Her house is an outlying one, and I
remember how the farm lights, scattered all
about our river hills, shone in the soft autumn
evening.
</p>
<p>
Her bright warm kitchen was coziness itself,
with a shiny stove, full to the brim with red
coals, and a big lamp. She sat with her cat on
her knee, sewing on an orange and green cushion,
made in queer little puffs, and she jumped
up, dropping thimble, and spectacles, in her
warm-hearted welcome. After my errand, we
fell into talk, about “Cap’n,” and their long
voyaging together. That was when the Captains
as a matter of course took their wives,
and often their children, with them, keeping
a cow on board for the family’s use, and
sometimes chickens and pigs. Many babies
who grew to be sturdy citizens were born
on the high seas in those days.
</p>
<p>
She told about long peaceful days, slipping
through the Trades, and about gales, but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46'></a>46</span>
mostly about china and pottery, for this was
their hobby, almost their passion. They took
inconvenient journeys of great length to see
new potteries, and hoped at last to see all the
sea-board china factories, in East and West.
She showed me her treasures, pretty bits of
Sevres, majolica, Doulton, and Wedgewood,
all standing together, and among them an
alabaster model of the leaning tower of Pisa
(Pysa, she called it). At last, with a lowered
voice, she spoke of the worst danger they had
ever been through, a typhoon in the Bay of
Bengal. The ship lay dismasted, and the
waves broke over her helplessness. She was
lifted up and dashed down like a log, and
every soul on board expected only to perish.
</p>
<p>
“Cap’n come downstairs to our cabin:
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Mary,” he says, “if only you was to
home! I could die easy if only you was to
home!”
</p>
<p>
“I be to home!” I says. “If I had the
wings of a dove, I wouldn’t be anywheres
but where I be!”
</p>
<p>
This ranks with the epitaph at Nantucket:
</p>
<p>
“Think what a wife should be, and she
was that!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47'></a>47</span>
</p>
<p>
Another seafaring friend was, as so often
happens, the last person whom you would
ever connect with adventures, a little lady so
tiny, so dainty, that a trip across the lawn
with garden gloves and hat, to tie up her
roses, might have been her longest excursion;
but instead she has sailed round and round
the world with her courtly sea-captain father,
has lifted her quiet gray eyes to see coral
islands and spice islands, and the strange
mountain ranges of the East Indies.
</p>
<p>
“She wore white mostly when we were in
the Trades or the Tropics,” her father has
told me, “and she sat on deck all day, with
her white fancy-work. She always seemed
to like whatever was happening.”
</p>
<p>
One day, in a fog with a heavy sea running,
the ship ran on a reef. The life-saving crew
got the men off with great difficulty, but the
Captain refused to leave his post, and little
Miss Jessie refused too.
</p>
<p>
“No, thank you,” she said, in her soft voice,
“No, thanks very much, I think I will stay
with the Captain.”
</p>
<p>
“And you couldn’t move her,” he said,
“any more than the rock of Gibraltar.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48'></a>48</span>
</p>
<p>
With the night the storm lessened, and almost
by a miracle the ship was got off safely
next morning.
</p>
<p>
I must tell of one more seafaring couple,
who lived down the river in a low white cottage
where “Captain,” retired from service,
could watch vessels passing, even without his
handsome brass-bound binoculars, a much-prized
tribute for life-saving.
</p>
<p>
The wife was long paralyzed, and the Captain,
with the simple-minded nephew they
had adopted, tended her as he might have
tended an adored child. He bought her silk
waists, fine aprons, little frills of one sort or
another, fastened them on her with clumsy,
loving fingers, and then would sit back, laughing
with pride, while the paralyzed woman,
with her wrecked face, managed to make uncouth
sounds of pleasure.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t she look handsome? Don’t she
look nice as anybody?” he would ask of the
neighbors, and show the new wig he had
bought her, as the poor hair was thin. His
simple pride thought it as beautiful as any
young girl’s curls, and indeed it was very
youthful. One’s heart was wrung, yet
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49'></a>49</span>
uplifted, too, for here was love which had passed
through the absolute wrecking of life, and
was untouched.
</p>
<p>
The Captain was a tall hearty man, but it
was he who died first, after all, and all in a
minute. The paralyzed creature thus bereaved,
moaned, day after day; her eyes
seemed to be asking for something, there in
the room, and no one could find the right
thing, till someone thought of the Captain’s
binoculars, which he always had by him.
From that moment she became tranquil, and
even grew happy again, if only she had the
bright brass thing where her poor hand could
touch it. If it was moved, she moaned for
it to be set back. It was her precious token,
from his hand to hers. With it beside
her she could wait and be good, poor dear
soul, until, in about two years, her release
came, and she went to join “Captain.”
</p>
<p>
One word more about Mr. Peter Simons, of
whom the town keeps pleasant memories. He
lived handsomely, in a handsome house overlooking
the river, and his housekeeper, Deborah
Twycross, was as much of a magnate
in her own way as himself. Mr. Peter was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50'></a>50</span>
very high with her; but he stood in awe of
her, too. Still, he never would let her engage
his second servant, a privilege which she
coveted.
</p>
<p>
In his young days a “hired girl” received
$2.00 a week wages, if she could milk, $1.50
if she could not. By the time Mr. Peter was
established in stately bachelor housekeeping
no girl was any longer expected to milk, and
few knew how. But when engaging a servant,
if he did not like the applicant’s looks,
Mr. Peter would say,
</p>
<p>
“Can you milk?”
</p>
<p>
Of course, she could not, and there the
matter would end. He never asked a girl
whose looks he liked, if she could milk!
</p>
<p>
He was a man of endless secret benevolence,
and posed all the time as a hard-fisted
person and a miser. He was at the most devious
pains to conceal his constant kindnesses.
The noble minister who at that time carried
our Town on his young shoulders, received
sums of money, in every time of need, for
library, schools, or cases of poverty and suffering,
directed in a variety of elaborately
disguised handwritings. He was able in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51'></a>51</span>
time to trace them all to Mr. Peter. Many
a struggling young man was set on his feet
and established in life by this secret benefactor;
and after Mr. Peter’s death, his
coal dealer told how for years he had had
orders to deliver loads of coal to this and
that family in distress, after dark, and as
noiselessly as possible, under an agreement
of secrecy, enforced by such threats that he
never dared disobey.
</p>
<p>
The Town has changed since Mr. Peter’s
day. Boys no longer brave the terrors of a
visit to a White Witch to have their warts
charmed, or a toothache healed. (“Mother
Hatch,” who plied her arts some thirty years
ago, was the last of these. Her appliances
for fortune-telling were the correct ones of
cards, an ink-well, and a glass to gaze in;
but a small trembling sufferer in knickerbockers—a
hero to the still more trembling
group of friends and eggers-on outside—did
not benefit by these higher mysteries.
The enchantress, beside her traffic in the black
arts, took in washing; she would withdraw
her hands from the suds, and lay a reeking
finger on the offending tooth, the patient
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52'></a>52</span>
gasping and shutting his terror-stricken eyes
while she recited a sufficient incantation.)
</p>
<p>
Even the memory of the Whipping-post,
which still stood in Mr. Peter’s childhood, has
long since vanished. The town bell is no
longer rung at seven in the morning and at
noon, and a steam fire-whistle has replaced
the tocsin of alarm that formerly was rung
from all the church steeples; but the curfew
still rings every night, at nine in the evening
(the bell which rings it was made by Paul
Revere); and, among the customary Scriptural-sounding
offices of fence-viewers, field-drivers,
measurers of wood and bark, etc.,
the town still has a town crier. A very few
years ago it still had a pound-keeper and
hog-reeve, but by now the outlines of the
pound itself have disappeared.

<h1>CHAPTER V—BY THE ACUSHTICOOK</h1>
<p>
&#160;<br />
</p>
<p>
A smaller river, the Acushticook, tumbles
and foams down through the midst of our
town, and brings us the wonderfully soft
pure water of a chain of over twenty lakes
and ponds. It flung the hills apart to join
the larger stream which it meets at right
angles at the Town Bridge, and the last
mile of its course is through a beautiful small
gorge, in a succession of falls, now compacted
into the eight dams which turn our mills.
</p>
<p>
Above the falls, though it breaks into
occasional rapids, its course is quieter, and
as you travel towards the setting sun, your
canoe follows a peaceful stream, running for
the most part through woods.
</p>
<p>
The country along the Acushticook is
broken and hilly, woods or open pastures full
of boulders and junipers. The farms depend
on their stock and apple orchards for their
prosperity. You see big chicken yards, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54'></a>54</span>
the more enterprising farmers send their eggs
and broilers to city markets. Pigs do well
among the apple trees, and most of the farms
have ducks and geese as well as chickens. A
well-trodden road follows the crest of the
ridge, parallel to the river.
</p>
<p>
The Baxters, good, silent people, live well
out on this road, and handsome Ambrose Baxter
has a thriving milk route. Sefami Baxter,
his uncle, worked in the paper mill his whole
life, and now his son, young Sefami, has
built up a good market garden business on
the Acushticook road. He started it years
ago with a tiny greenhouse, which he built
on to his farm kitchen. He raised tomatoes
and other seedlings, and early lettuce. It
was an innovation in our part of the world,
and neighbors shook their heads; but one bit
of greenhouse was added to another, and now
Sefami has three long stacks of them and is
a prosperous man. He has a whole field of
rhubarb and a large orchard, where he keeps
twenty hives of bees. He had no capital beyond
the savings of a plain working family,
and he had to find his market for himself.
</p>
<p>
The Drews, now old people, live beyond
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55'></a>55</span>
Ambrose Baxter, and life has been a more
poignant thing for them than for most of
the farm neighbors. Their boy, Lawrence,
was born for learning. He <em>foamed</em> to it, as
a stream rushes down hill, and he had the
vision and faithfulness which lead to high and
lonely places. The parents were industrious
and frugal, and Lawrence was the channel
through which everything they had, mind and
ambitions as well as savings, poured itself
out. As a boy, he was all ardor and eagerness.
Now he is a tall careworn man of
fifty, unmarried, with hair and beard streaked
with gray. He is a man of importance in
many ways beside that of his own department
in a great Western university. He is
a good son, and comes home to the comfortable
white farmhouse for every day in the
year that it is possible, but his parents, of
necessity, have had to grow old without him,
and their look, in speaking of him, is one of
acceptance, as well as of a high pride.
</p>
<p>
Acushticook has changed her course from
time to time through the centuries, and about
five miles from town a stretch of flat land
which must once have been either intervale
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56'></a>56</span>
along the river’s course or one of its many
small lakes, lies pocketed among the hills.
This stretch, which is very fertile, belongs,
or belonged, to the Dunnacks, and they were
surely a family which will be remembered.
They never pretended to be anything more
than plain farming people, but they were
marked by a personal dignity and refinement,
even fastidiousness, by their intelligence, and
alas, by their many sorrows. Old Warren
Dunnack was a farmer of substance. His
son, the Warren Dunnack of our time, was
nearly all his life in charge of the “Homestead”
(one of the few country places in
our neighborhood), during the long absence
abroad of its owners. He married a beautiful
woman, Sarah Brant. She was a magnificent
creature, in a hard, almost animal sort
of way, but was a shallow person, with a
vain nature, coveting show, fine food and
clothes, and she broke Warren’s heart. He
took her back again and again after her many
flights, for he had an unconquerable chivalry
and gentleness for all women, and he let her
have everything that he could earn.

<span class='caption'>INTERVALE ALONG THE RIVER’S COURSE</span>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57'></a>57</span></div>
<p>
Lucretia was the beauty of the family, a
slip of a girl with eyes like black diamonds.
She married a showy business man, who
turned out badly. She came home, a handsome
and embittered older woman, and made
life uncomfortable for herself and everyone
else on the farm. Afterwards she became
companion to a widow of some means, a
fantastic person, and they lived together (unharmoniously)
all their days.
</p>
<p>
Delia, who was so pretty, though not striking
like Lucretia, married silly Ephraim Simmons;
but her affection for her brother Warren
was the abiding thing of her life. When
Warren’s wife left him, and Delia was offered
the position of housekeeper at the Homestead,
she took it, and there she and Warren kept
house for fifteen years. Two good-natured
slack daughters (they were all Simmons; not
a trace of their mother’s fire in them) helped
Ephraim with his farm, and he certainly
needed the money that their mother earned.
He was a poor enough farmer; but his foolish
face used to look wistful when he drove the
six miles, every other Saturday, to see Delia.
</p>
<p>
Delia, for her part, never seemed anything
but clear as to her duty. She drove over
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58'></a>58</span>
now and then to see Ephraim, and sent her
money to him and the girls, or put it in the
bank for them, but her heart clave to her
brother. She kept the long delightfully
rambling house, and he kept the farm, lawns,
and gardens, punctiliously in order for the
owners who never came; and the honeysuckles
blossomed in the corner of the great
dark hedges, the lilies opened, and the grapes
ripened and dropped on the sunny terraces of
the garden as the unmarked years went by. I
think that Delia’s life was one of untroubled
serenity. Warren was a grave man, and his
trouble with his wife underlay all his days,
but with Delia he found a rare companionship
and understanding. Their sitting-room
in the ell of the big house was a gathering
place for the farm neighbors. There was a
deep fireplace, a table with a big lamp, a
sofa, high-backed arm-chairs with worsted-work
cushions and tidies, and windows filled
with blossoming plants.
</p>
<p>
Warren died after a lingering illness, which
he met with his usual grave cheerfulness, and
Delia went back to Ephraim on the Acushticook
road. Whatever she thought of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59'></a>59</span>
difference between the Homestead and the bare
little farm, between Warren and Ephraim,
she met the change with the charming, half-whimsical
philosophy that was hers through
life. She had pretty ways, and an unconquerable
sense of fun. She lived to be nearly
eighty. She was a fine, fine woman; delicately
organized, but of such vigorous fibre
that she struck her roots deep into life, and
gave out good to everyone who came near
her. She was a magnet, drawing people by
her warmth and sweetness.
</p>
<p>
It was to poor, good, hard-working John
Dunnack that actual tragedy came. He was a
plain dull man, of a far humbler stripe than
his brothers. Misfortune came to his only
child, a young adopted daughter. He lost
his place at the mill not long after, from
age. He was eighty years old. It was too
much. His mind failed, and he took his own
life.
</p>
<p>
A cheerful family, the Greenleafs, live next
beyond the Dunnacks. They keep bees on
a large scale, and “Greenleaf Honey,” in
pretty-shaped glass jars, with a green beech
leaf on the label, has had its established
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60'></a>60</span>
market for two generations. They also grew
cherries for market, nearly as large as
damsons.
</p>
<p>
Harvey Greenleaf had luck, and has what
our people know as “gumption,” and “git-up-and-git,”
and Mrs. Greenleaf, a fair, ample
person, is a born woman of business. Once a
neighbor, a farm hand, who had been discharged
for slackness, planted buckwheat in
a small clearing next the Greenleafs’, out of
spite. (Buckwheat honey is unmarketable,
because of its marked peculiar flavor, and
its dark color.) Harvey was away at the
County Grange Meeting—he was Master of
his Grange that year—at the time it flowered.
Two little girls, out picking wild raspberries,
brought word of the trouble.
</p>
<p>
“Mis’ Greenleaf! Mis’ Greenleaf! There’s
buckwheat in blow at Jasper Derry’s clearing,
an’ it’s full of your bees!”
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Greenleaf harnessed up the old white
mare herself, and drove over to the offender’s
house. No one knows how she dealt with
him, but the buckwheat was cut before night.
Harvey chuckles, and says she swung the
scythe herself. Not much harm was done, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61'></a>61</span>
only a little of the yield turned out to have
been injured by the buckwheat.
</p>
<p>
There are no rules about the planting of
buckwheat near bee-hives. It is a matter of
good feeling and neighborliness, and buckwheat
is seldom grown where a neighbor
keeps bees for profit; but it is impossible to
guard against the trouble entirely and I have
known a whole season’s yield to be discolored
with honey brought from buckwheat, nine
miles from the hives.
</p>
<p>
One early morning this June, as we were at
breakfast on the piazza, a boy came round
the corner of the house, and asked if we
wanted “a quart of wild strawberries, a pint
of cream, and a dozen of Mother’s fresh rolls,
for forty cents!” We certainly did; and in
the driveway we saw “Mother” waiting in
the wagon, an alert-looking woman with a
friendly face. She told us that she was
Harvey Greenleaf’s daughter-in-law, and the
boy her eldest son.
</p>
<p>
“I think there’s lots of small extra business
that folks can do on the farms, if they’re
spry, that sets things ahead a lot,” she said,
<em>à propos</em> of the strawberries.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62'></a>62</span>
</p>
<p>
The rolls were as light as feather, and the
cream very thick. We arranged for the same
bargain twice a week while the berry season
lasted!
</p>
<p>
In the autumn the same couple came again,
this time with vegetables and fruit, nicely
arranged, and with small cakes of fresh cream
cheese done up in waxed paper in neat packages,
each package stamped with S. Greenleaf,
Eagle Cliff Farm. This is a new venture
in our part of the country.
</p>
<p>
A mile of beautiful pasture, on a big scale,
as smooth as an English down, slopes down
from the back of the Greenleafs’ farm, rises
in a noble ridge, and slopes again to where
the Acushticook sparkles and dances over
some thirty yards of rapids. The turf is
close cropped and there are boulders and
groups of half-sized firs and spruces scattered
over the slope. There is a little wood in the
upper corner, cool and shadowy, with a
brooklet set deep in mosses, trickling through
the midst. The pasture road leads through
the firs and hemlocks, growing closer and
more feathery, then through this wood, where
Lady’s Slippers grow.

<h1>CHAPTER VI—SPRING</h1>
<p>
&#160;<br />
</p>
<p>
April 3.
Last night the river “went out.” We were
so used, all winter, to its sleeping whiteness,
that it seemed as unlikely to change as the
outlines of the hills; then came a tumultuous
week, and now it is a brown, strong, full-running
stream, with swirls and whirlpools
of hastening current all over its wide surface.
These are indescribable days. The air is
sweet with wet bark and melting snow and
newly-uncovered earth. The lesser streams
are rushing and roaring through the woods.
There are little clear dark foam-topped pools
under all the spouts, and bright drops falling
from rocks and roofs, where there were icicles
so lately; and the roads endure miniature
floods, from the torrents of snow-water that
gush down their gutters and spread the mud
in fan-shapes over them. Wherever you
stand, you cannot get away from the rushing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64'></a>64</span>
and trickling and rilling. The whole
frozen strength of winter is breaking up in a
wealth of life-giving waters.
</p>
<p>
There is a neglected-looking time for the
fields just after the snow goes. The snow-patches
recede and leave the soaked grass
covered with odds and ends of loose sticks
and roots and with untidy wefts of cobweb.
The dead leaves lie limp and dank, and are
of lovely but sad colors, soft browns and
umbers, ash-grays and ash-purples; but in the
midst of this waste the ponds are all awake—dimpling,
soft water, tender and alive—and
their bright blue is a new wonder after our
winter world of white and brown and gray.
</p>
<p>
Robins came yesterday. Their crisp voices
woke us with a start, after the winter’s
silence. They were busy all over the lawn,
and nearly a week ago we heard the first
blue-birds and meadow-larks.
</p>
<p>
The fir boughs that were banked about the
houses last fall, for warmth, must be burnt,
and bonfires are being lighted all about the
fields and gardens. They blaze up into a
crackling roar of burning brush, and the
smoke comes pouring and creaming out
in thick white torrents. The clean, hilarious
smell spreads everywhere, the touch of it
clings to our hair and clothing. This is a
wonderful, Indian time for children, when all
sorts of strange inherited knowledge stirs in
them. Look at their eyes, as they play and
plan round their fires!

<span class='caption'>THE SOUTH WIND IN MARCH</span>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65'></a>65</span></div>
<p>
Cumulus clouds came back, as always, with
late winter. Through the autumn, and early
winter, clear days are practically cloudless;
and cloud-masses, cirrus, not cumulus, herald
and follow storms; but with February, the
clear-weather summer clouds return. They
begin to be trim again, and marshaled, and
take up the ordered leisurely sailing of their
pretty squadrons.
</p>
<p>
April 10.
</p>
<p>
There is already a general warming and
yellowing of twigs. The elm tops are growing
feathery and show a warm brown, and a
crimson-coral mist begins to flush over the
low-lying woods, where the swamp maples
are in flower. Pussy-willows are as thick on
their twigs as drops after a rain, and as
silvery. You would say at first that nothing
had changed yet in the main forest. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66'></a>66</span>
brown aisles and misty dark hollows seem
the same, but no; fringed about the openings
and coverts along their borders the birch and
alder catkins are in flower. They are powdery
and gold-colored, and overhead they dangle
like the tails of little fairy sheep against the
sky.
</p>
<p>
The wild geese woke us in the dark, just
before dawn, this morning. Last year there
was a violent snow-storm, a perfect smothering
whirl of flakes, the night they flew over,
and the great birds were beaten down among
the house-tops, creakling and honkling in dismay
and confusion, but holding on their
way.
</p>
<p>
Now at dusk comes the first silvery evening
whistling of the frogs, the peepers. If
a cloud passes over the sun, even as early
as three in the afternoon, they start up as
if at a signal, all together, and as the sun
shines out again fall instantly silent.
</p>
<p>
May 3.
</p>
<p>
All this time the green has been spreading
and spreading through the pastures till now
it clothes them, and the dandelions are scattered
over them like a king’s largesse. Dew
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67'></a>67</span>
falls all winter, but it is in star and fern
shapes of frost; now every morning and evening
the thick grass is pearled again with a
million nourishing drops.
</p>
<p>
Now rainbow colors begin to show over the
hillsides. It is as if a thousand and a thousand
tiny butterflies, pink and cream color
and living green and crimson, had alighted
in the woods. Light comes through them,
and they give back light, from the shining,
fine down that covers them. The little leaves
are almost like clear jewels against the sun,
beaded all over the twigs. They only make a
slightly dotted veil as yet, they do not hide
or screen. You can see as far into the wood-openings
as in winter. The brown stems and
branches are as delicate and distinct as those
of a bed of maiden-hair fern.
</p>
<p>
The roadside willows are puffs of gold-green
smoke, the sapling birches and quaking aspens
like green mounting flames up the hillsides,
and the catkins of the canoe birches shine like
the mist of gold sparks from a rocket.
</p>
<p>
The different trees develop by different
stages, and each stands out in turn against
its fellows, as if illuminated, before it loses
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68'></a>68</span>
itself in the growing sea of green. You see
its full leafy shape, the mass of each round
top, as at no other time of year; yet
the individual habit of branching is still
manifest, as in winter: the long springing
sprays of the swamp maples, the more compact
strong branches of the oaks, the maze-like
firm twigs of the hop-hornbeams, lying
in whorls and layers. The branchlets of the
beeches are like thorns. The elms are soft
brown spirits of trees throughout the woods;
their entire fern-like outline is silhouetted,
and the swamp maples stand like delicate
living shapes of bronze.
</p>
<p>
Innocents are out in patches in the pastures,
looking as if white powder had been
spilt. Purple and white hepaticas are clustered
in crannies of the rocks, and after a
rain mayflowers stand up thick, thick in the
fields, in masses of pink and white fragrance.
Blood-root covers whole banks with snow-white,
and dog-tooth violets, littlest of lilies,
nod their yellow-and-brown prettiness over
the slopes carpeted with their strange mottled
leaves.
</p>
<p>
Shad-bush is out now in fairy white,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69'></a>69</span>
tasseled over knolls and hillsides and overhanging
wooded banks along the streams. Its
opening leaves are reddish, delicately serrate,
and finely downy. The pure white flowers are
loosely starred all over it. They are long-petaled
and lightly hung, and the tree is
slender and very pliable, the whole thing suggesting
a delicate raggedness, as if young
Spring went lightly on bare feet with fluttering
clothes.
</p>
<p>
This is the most fairy-scented time of the
whole year. “The wood-bine spices are wafted
abroad,” indeed. The willows perfume the
lanes with their intoxicating sweetness; and
there is a cool pure dawn-like fragrance everywhere,
from the countless millions of opening
leaves, steeped every night with dew.
</p>
<p>
Last week we saw the first swallows.
There they skimmed and flew, as if they
had never gone to other skies at all. Their
flight is so effortless, they seem to pour and
stream down unseen cataracts of air. To-day
chimney-swallows came, and we watched
their endless rippling and circling. They
sailed and wheeled, in little companies or
singly, now twittering and now silent, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70'></a>70</span>
from now on all summer the sky will never
be empty of their beautiful activities.
</p>
<p>
May 26.
</p>
<p>
At last the woods are like a garden of
delicate flowers, clothing the hills as far as
eye can see with colors of sunrise. The
red-oaks are gold color, with strong brown
stems; ash and lindens are golden green;
maples soft copper and bronze, or deep flesh-color.
</p>
<p>
The flower-like delicacy of leafing out is
wonderfully prolonged. The willows come
first, then elms, in brown flower, then quaking-asps
and birches, and then maples. Later,
lindens and ash-trees catch the light, and the
ash leaves (which grow far apart, and in
bunches, with the flower-buds) are indeed
like just-alighted butterflies. The small leaves
are so bright that even in the rain they shine
as if a shaft of sunlight from some unseen
break in the clouds were lighting the
woods.
</p>
<p>
Now long shining leaf buds show among
the elm flowers and on the beeches. The
later poplars are cream-white and as downy
as velvet. A wood of maples and poplars
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71'></a>71</span>
is almost a pink-and-white wood; shell-pink,
and palest, most silvery-and-creamy gray.
</p>
<p>
The tall gold-colored red-oaks make masses
of strong color; and later, when we think the
shimmering of the fairy rainbow is fading, the
white oaks come out in a mist of pale carnation—pink
and gray and cream.
</p>
<p>
In June, after all the hardwoods have
merged into uniform light green, firs and
spruces become jeweled at every point with
tips of light, the new growth for the year.
Red pines and white pines are set all over
with candelabra of lighter green, until high
on the tops of the seeding white pines little
clusters of finger-slender pale green cones
begin to show.
</p>
<p>
By this time the forest-flowers have faded
through the woods. The brighter colors of
the field-flowers are gay along the roadsides
and over meadows and pastures, and with
them Summer has come.

<h1>CHAPTER VII—THE EASTMAN HILL CROSS-ROAD</h1>
<p>
&#160;<br />
</p>
<p>
The cross-road under the great leafy ridge
of Eastman Hill has pretty farms along it,
and half-way across there is a country burying
ground, where wild plums blossom, and the
grave-stones are half hidden all summer in
a green thicket.
</p>
<p>
One name in the graveyard we all hold
in special honor, that of Serena Eastman.
I never knew her myself, and it is only
from her granddaughter and from the neighbors
that I learned of her beautiful life.
</p>
<p>
She was a mother in Israel; one of
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“All-Saints—the&nbsp;unknown&nbsp;good&nbsp;that&nbsp;rest<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In&nbsp;God’s&nbsp;still&nbsp;memory&nbsp;folded&nbsp;deep.”<br />
</p>
<p>
She brought up eleven children to upright
manhood and womanhood, and beside this a
whole neighborhood was nourished from the
wells of her deep nature. She lived and died
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73'></a>73</span>
before the days of trained nurses, and in addition
to her own cares she was the principal
nurse of her countryside. Those were the
days when nursing was not and could not be
paid for, but was a priceless gift from neighbor
to neighbor. She stood ready to be up
all night, and night after night, to ease pain
by her ministering, or to help to bring a new
life into the world; her faith lifted the spirits
of the dying, and of those about to be bereaved,
as if on strong pinions.
</p>
<p>
Small-pox was still a terrible scourge in
those times, and she was the only woman in
the district who would nurse it. Her granddaughter
has told me how she kept a change
of clothes in an out-house, and how she
bathed and dressed there (the only precautions
against infection known to the times),
whether in winter or summer, before rejoining
her family. She always drove to and
from such cases at night, to run as little
danger as possible of coming in contact with
people. Her husband took the same risks
that she did. He drove back and forth,
and lent his strength in lifting and carrying
patients.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74'></a>74</span>
</p>
<p>
They had a large farm, which meant cooking
for hired men in the busy seasons, and
beside Serena’s eleven children there were
older relations to do for, her husband’s father
and mother, and one or two unmarried sisters.
She was active in Dorcas society and in meeting.
Her granddaughter feels that only the
completeness of her religious life could have
carried her through the fatigues which she
underwent. She lived in that conscious obedience
to duty which eliminates friction, and
her view of duty was one taken through wide-opened
windows. She walked with God
daily.
</p>
<p>
The house of this dear woman burned, not
long after she and her husband died, and only
the blossoming lilacs mark its empty cellar-hole,
but the next farm, which belonged to Mr.
Eastman’s brother, and is now his nephew’s, is
a fine one. You drive on to a wide green, as
smoothly kept as a lawn, where three huge
trees, a willow and two elms, overhang the
house. There are big comfortable barns and
outhouses, a corn-crib and well-sweep, and
the house is square and ample, with two big
chimneys.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75'></a>75</span>
</p>
<p>
Next to the Eastmans’, beyond their orchard,
comes a neat small farm, with a long
wide stone wall, where grapes are trained,
owned once by two queer old sisters, the
Misses Pushard, or as we have it, the Miss
Pushhards. (A Huguenot name, pronounced
<em>Pushaw</em> by the older generation.) They went
to Lyceum in their young days, and, a rare
thing then so far in the country, they had
a piano. This gave them “a great shape.”
Poor ladies, with their piano! Years later
they were in straitened circumstances, and
anxious to sell it, but to their indignation
nobody wanted it, or not at the price they
thought fitting; so, one night, they <em>chopped
it up</em>, and hid the pieces. Thus they were
not left with the instrument on their hands;
and they had not accepted an unworthy price
for their treasure. All this was learned years
afterwards from some old papers. The fragments
of the piano were found in the cistern.
</p>
<p>
The last farm on the road is owned by
Sam Marston and his dear wife, Susan; who,
though you never would think it (except for
a little remaining crispness of speech), was
born in England, in Essex, and came as a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76'></a>76</span>
young English housemaid—dear me, how
long ago now!—to the Homestead, eight
miles away, by the River. Sam Marston
worked there in the stables, and lost his heart
promptly, and after four or five years of
characteristic Yankee courting, leisurely, but
humorously determined, Susan made up her
mind, and said “yes,” and came out to the
farm, with her fresh print gowns, her trimness
and stanchness, and her abiding religion.
</p>
<p>
Susan keeps also her fixed ideas of the
“quality.” She is now a power in her whole
neighborhood. She and Sam, alas, have no
children, a great sorrow, but the young people
growing up near her show the reflection
of her uprightness and that of her Sam.
But after all these years she is still an exotic.
The Sunday-school which she has gathered
about her is strictly Church of England.
The children learn their catechism, and “to
do their duty in life in that station into
which it shall please God to call them”; and
they are instructed perfectly clearly as to
their betters!
</p>
<p>
The other day we drove out to her farm.
We were going to climb Eastman Hill, after
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77'></a>77</span>
Lady’s Slippers, and then were to have supper
with Susan.
</p>
<p>
The sky was very deep blue, with flocks of
little white clouds sailing. The woods were
still all different shades of light and bright
green, and the apple trees were in full blossom.
The barn swallows were skimming and
pouring low about the green fields in their
effortless flight. I think I never drove
through so smiling a country.
</p>
<p>
The house is a long low brick one, with
dormer windows, in the midst of an old
orchard. There is a fence and a hedge, and
a brick path leads to the door. There are
lilac bushes at the corner of the house, and
cinnamon roses and yellow lilies on each
side of the doorway.
</p>
<p>
Susan came out, laughing, and nearly crying,
with pleasure, to welcome us. She
“jumped” us down with her kind hands,
and took all our wraps. We went as far as
the house, asking questions and chattering,
and then Susan showed us our way, an opening
in the screen of the woods reached by a
path through the orchard, and stood shading
her eyes with her hand to look after us.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78'></a>78</span>
</p>
<p>
We followed a bit of mossy old corduroy
road, through moist rich woods, and then
began to climb among a wood of beeches.
Soon the rock began to crop out in small
cliffs, and we found different treasures, the
little pale pink <em>corydalis</em>, a black-and-white
creeper’s nest in a ferny cleft between two
rocks, quantities of twin-flower, and then,
rising a beech-covered knoll, we came on our
first Lady’s Slippers. The glade ahead was
thronged with them. They spread their
broad light-green leaves like wings, and their
beautiful heads bent proudly. They grew
sometimes singly, sometimes in clumps
of fifteen or twenty blossoms, and were
scattered over the whole glade as if a
flight of rose-colored butterflies had just
alighted.
</p>
<p>
We came on this same sight seven different
times; this lovely company scattered over
the slope among the rocks, where the ridge
broke out into low gray pinnacles among the
beeches.
</p>
<p>
When at last we could make up our minds
to climb down, following the white thread
of a waterfall, into the deeper woods, we
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79'></a>79</span>
found Painted Trilliums, bright white and
painted with crimson, with Jack-in-the-pulpits,
both grown to a great size in the rich mould,
amongst a green mist of uncurling ferns.
</p>
<p>
The brook which we followed came out at
last in an open pasture above the farm. It
was as refreshing as a bath in running water
to come out into the cool, sweet evening air, for
the heavy woods were warm, and there had
been quantities of black flies and mosquitoes,
which our hands were too full to fight. Beside
all our baskets, our handkerchiefs and
hats were full of flowers. One of our number
carried a young cherry tree, with roots and
sod, over his shoulder, and mosses in his
pockets, and the girls had Lady’s Slippers and
fern roots in their caught-up skirts.
</p>
<p>
The turf was powdered white as snow with
Innocents, and there were violets. The pasture
slopes down through dark needle-pointed
clumps of balsam fir, and scattered hawthorn
and cherry trees, which were in flower.
A hermit thrush sang from one of the firs
as we came down. The heavenly, pure carillon
rang out again and again, as dusk fell
deeper, the singer altering the pitch with each
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80'></a>80</span>
repetition of the song, ringing one lovely
change after another.
</p>
<p>
Such a supper was set out on the porch!
Fresh rolls and butter, cream cheese and
chicken, jugs of milk and cream, fresh hot
gingerbread, and bowls of wild strawberries.
The porch runs out into the orchard, and the
white petals of the apple-blossoms drifted
down as we sat laughing and talking. Susan
placed her chair near us, but nothing would
induce her to eat with us, and she jumped up
every minute and fluttered into the house, to
press more good things on us. Presently,
Sam came in from milking, and was a fellow-Yankee
and a brother at once.
</p>
<p>
We could hardly bear to go home, and almost
took Sam’s offer (which so scandalized
Susan) of a night in the hay in the new
barn. It would be so pretty to lie watching
the swallows darting in and out after sunrise.
</p>
<p>
We went all through Susan’s trim farmhouse,
and saw her dairy, with its airy
and spotless arrangements. The milk, thick
and yellow with cream, was in curious blue
glass pans, which Susan said came long ago
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81'></a>81</span>
from the Homestead. We saw all the chickens,
the calves, and the black pigs. The
Jerseys blew long breaths at us from their
mangers, and the horses put out their soft
noses for sugar. The ducks were quacking
and waddling all over the yard, and the
pigeons fluttered about.
</p>
<p>
The late veeries and robins were singing,
and the warm fragrance of the apple-blossoms
was all about us, as we gathered our
treasures together and drove home in the
dusk.

<h1>CHAPTER VIII—RIDGEFIELD, AND WEIR’S MILLS</h1>
<p>
&#160;<br />
</p>
<p>
The two adjoining districts of Ridgefield
and Weir’s Mills lie about ten miles to the
east of us, in level and fertile farm country,
between two ridges of hills. Ridgefield is
an old Roman Catholic settlement. Twenty-five
years ago it still had a prosperous convent,
and children educated in the convent
school have gone out all over the country; but
the centre of the farming population shifted,
and at last the convent was closed. The
cheerful-faced, black-gowned sisters are all
gone. The bell has been silent for years now,
and its tower stands up with blank windows,
nothing more than a strange landmark in the
open farming landscape.
</p>
<p>
The Ridgefield Irish were a noted community.
They all came from one county,
and were marked to a surprising degree by
their personal beauty. There were Esmonds
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83'></a>83</span>
and Desmonds, Considines, Burkes, and McCanns,
and two names now gone (except for
one old representative) Guilfoyles and Guilshannons.
Four lovely Esmond girls of one
family are now growing up, bearing four
saints’ names—Agatha, Ursula, Patricia,
Cecily.
</p>
<p>
Honoria Considine walks down our street,
beautiful creature that she is, with a port
and carriage that a princess might envy.
She has brought up an orphaned nephew and
niece to capability and prosperity, supporting
them entirely by her sewing. The Considines
have possessions which show that they
came to this country as something more than
farmers. They have a little old silver, two
finely inlaid card-tables in the farm “best-room,”
and two larger mahogany tables.
They are great prohibitionists, and would be
shocked, good souls, to know that what they
call the “old refrigerator” is a beautifully
carved wine-cooler!
</p>
<p>
Lawrence McCann and Joe Fitzgerald were
two as handsome creatures as ever were
seen, with great dark blue eyes, delicate
brows, dark curls, and mantling Irish color.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84'></a>84</span>
</p>
<p>
Lawrence died of consumption at twenty-four,
as did his cousin, delightful Con Guilshannon,
but Joe did well and married. The
other day I saw him out walking with three
little rosy children, all with penciled eyebrows
and very dark blue eyes.
</p>
<p>
There lives an old lady in a great western
city (I don’t give its name) who ought to
wear a crown instead of a bonnet. The town
trembles before her masterful benevolence.
Her magnificent house dominates the “best
community,” and her six middle-aged married
children, established near-by in houses of
equal magnificence, do not dare call their
souls their own.
</p>
<p>
A neighbor of mine was in her city last
year, and was taken to see her. The old
lady seemed to know an amazing amount,
not only about our far-away eastern State,
but about our actual county. She finally
showed such an absorbing interest in particular
households that my friend said:
</p>
<p>
“But how can you know? How <em>can</em> you
have heard about so-and-so?”
</p>
<p>
“Child,” said the old chieftainess, her fine
eyes twinkling and filling, “My name is no
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85'></a>85</span>
guide to you now, except that it’s Irish, but
I was born and brought up in your county.
I was an Esmond from Ridgefield, and had
my schooling at the convent, not six miles
from your door.”
</p>
<p>
After Ridgefield, with its deserted convent,
you come presently to where the rolling country
is suddenly flung amazingly apart in the
chasm-like valley of the Winding River.
Weir’s Mills, the village at the head of navigation,
is a pleasant peaceful little place,
a very old settlement, with a noted old church.
</p>
<p>
A neighbor of ours, a man now of eighty, has
told me that in his childhood at Weir’s Mills,
the school had neither paper nor blackboard
nor slates for the children to write on. The
teacher smoothed the ashes of the hearthstone
out flat with a shingle, and the children
did their figuring on that. Farmers going
into town chalked the figures of their sales
on their beaver hats, and the assessor chalked
the taxes up on the doors.
</p>
<p>
The school-teachers were taken to board
in turn, two weeks at a time, by different
families; and a friend, now an elderly woman,
has told me that when teaching, as a young
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86'></a>86</span>
girl, she had as a rule to share her bed with
three or four children of the family. In several
places the hens slept in the room too.
The schools of course were ungraded. After
her teaching hours she helped in the housework,
but she liked it, and made warm
friends. She found the life vigorous and
hardy—“It was life that was every bit of
it alive,” she has told me.
</p>
<p>
It is sometimes said that marriage and
divorce are taken lightly in the country districts,
and certainly the Jingroes and their
like, of whom more later, make their gipsy
marriages, which bind only at will; but even
among some of our outlying communities of
far higher standing than the forest settlements,
it is true that a curious, primitive view
of wedlock often obtains. Marriages in the
country are deep as the rock, enduring as the
hills, <em>once the real mate is found</em>. The fine,
toil-worn faces of man and wife, in Golden-Wedding
and Four-generations groups in
local newspapers, show a thing before which
one puts off the shoes from off one’s feet.
But, when husband and wife find only misery
in their marriage, find themselves fundamentally
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87'></a>87</span>
at variance, they quietly “get a bill,” (<em>i. e.</em>
of divorce,) and each is considered free to
marry again. The adjustment, according to
their lights, is made decently and in order; and
all cases come quickly before the final court of
public opinion, which in these clear-eyed country
districts metes out an inexorable judgment
to lightness, to cowardice or selfishness.
</p>
<p>
It is difficult not to mis-state, about so
subtle a matter; but the attitude of these
neighborhoods is not a lax one. It is rather
as if, in places so small, where the margin
of everything is so narrow, the tremendous
exigencies of life enforce a tolerance which
is no conscious action of men’s minds, but a
thing larger than themselves, before which
they must bow. Life is so simple and
vital, so cleared by necessity of a million
extraneous complexities, that people are able,
as one of the Saints says, to judge the action
by the person, not the person by the action.
</p>
<p>
Long ago there was plenty of shipping
direct from Weir’s Mills to Boston, and even
to-day scows, and a few small schooners,
come up between the hills for hay and wood,
up all the windings of the Winding River,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88'></a>88</span>
slipping through the draws at the peaceful,
pretty hamlets of Upper, Middle, and Lower
Bridge.
</p>
<p>
The country about Weir’s Mills shows in
indefinable ways that you are approaching the
sea. You get the taste of salt, with a south
wind, more often than with us. The roads
show sandy, and you see an occasional clump
of sweet bay in the pastures. The pines grow
more and more dwarfed, and so maritime in
look that you expect to see blue water and
the masts of ships ten miles before you come
to them. We came on another indication one
day, in asking our way of a young girl at a
farm door.
</p>
<p>
“The second turn to the <em>west</em>,” she told us.
In our part of the county we do not often
think of the points of the compass. “The
second turn on your left,” it would have
been.
</p>
<p>
This is one of our older districts, and a
certain amount of old-fashioned speech remains.
Many persons still speak of <em>ninepence</em>
(twelve and a half cents) and a <em>shilling</em> (sixteen
and two-thirds cents). A High School
pupil (one of the many boys who walk
three or four miles in to our Town, in all
weathers, to get their schooling) brought in
some Mountain Ash berries to the botanical
class. <em>Round-Tree berries</em>, he called them,
and the master was puzzled, until he realized
that this meant <em>Rowan Tree</em>, and that the
name had come down straight from the boy’s
English forefathers, who picked the rowan
berries by their home streams.

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89'></a>89</span></div>
<p>
All through our county, and in our Town
itself, among the homelier neighbors, many
of the old strong preterites, which have become
obsolete elsewhere, are still in use. “I
<em>wed</em> the garden,” for “I <em>weeded</em>,” “I <em>bet</em> the
carpet”; <em>riz</em> for <em>raised</em>, <em>hove</em> for <em>heaved</em>; and
among our old established families of substance
you may still hear <em>shew</em> for <em>showed</em> and
<em>clim</em> for <em>climbed</em>.
</p>
<p>
“I <em>clim</em> a little ways up into the rigging,”
one of our magnates said to me this very
week, speaking of an adventure of his seafaring
youth.
</p>
<p>
After the Revolution certain of the unfortunate
Hessians drifted to the southern
part of our county, and being stranded, poor
souls, they made the best of it, settled and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90'></a>90</span>
married. They named our town of Dresden.
The Theobalds come from this Hessian stock,
the Vannahs, who started as Werners, the
Dockendorffs, and we have a precious although
extremely local seashore name, <em>Winkiepaw</em>,
which began life as Wenckebach.
But the adaptation of surnames is in process
all around us. Uriah Briery’s people used to
be <em>Brieryhurst</em>; and Samuel Powers has told
me that his grandfather wrote his name in
“a queer Frenchy sort of way, he spelled it
<em>de la Poer</em>”(!) The Goslines, of whom we
have a good sized family, were <em>du Gueslins</em>,
not long since, and Alec Duffy, who sounds
entirely Irish, was born <em>Alexis D’Urfeé</em>.
</p>
<p>
A queer old person lived on the Weir’s
Mills road when we were children. He had
prospered in farming and trade, and was
quite a rich man for those parts. He wanted
to be richer still, and all his last years he
was ridden by two chimerical dreams; one,
that a piece of his land was to be bought
for a monster hotel, at a fabulous price, and
the other that Captain Kidd’s treasure was
buried in a small island he owned in the
river. He dug and he dug for it. He had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91'></a>91</span>
absolute faith in the superstition that a fork
of green wood—perhaps of witch-hazel only,
but I am not sure about this—held firmly in
both hands, will point straight to buried water
or buried treasure. He has led us all over his
island, holding the forked stick.
</p>
<p>
“There! See him! See him turn!” he
would cry out excitedly. “Wild oxen won’t
hold him!” The stick certainly turned in
his hands, and in ours, when he placed it
right for us. I suppose the wood is so elastic
and springy that, holding it in a certain way
you unconsciously turn it yourself; but it
gave a queer feeling.
</p>
<p>
This whole district is fragrant with the
memory of a saint, Mary Scott. She was
a cripple her whole life. Her shoulders and
the upper part of her body were those of a
powerful woman, but her feet and legs were
those of a child, and were withered and useless.
She lived all alone when I knew her,
in a tiny neat house. She spent her days in
a child’s cart, which she could move about
by the wheels with her hands, and she was
most active and busy.
</p>
<p>
No one could go through a life of such
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92'></a>92</span>
affliction without untellable suffering; but
Mary’s sweet faith never seemed to know that
she had a self at all, still less a crippled self.
She had quick skillful hands, and her absorbing
pleasure all through the year was her
work for her Christmas tree. She saved, and
her neighbors saved for her, every bit of tinfoil
and silver or gold paper that could be
found, and fashioned out of it bright stars and
spangles for trimming. She knitted and
knitted, mittens and stockings and comforters,
and when the time came near she
made candy, and corn-balls, and strung popcorn
into garlands. The neighbors all helped
her, and good Jacob Damren, at Tresumpscott,
always cut her a tree from his woods
and set it up for her; and then on Christmas
Eve the door of her cottage stood open, and
the light streamed out from the bright
lighted tree, and the children of the whole
district came thronging in with their parents.
</p>
<p>
The tributary streams from this eastern
side of our river come in very quietly. Worromontogus,
the largest, is dammed just as
it emerges from its hills, to turn the Wilsons’
saw-mill, which was once owned and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93'></a>93</span>
run by Mary Scott’s father. The mill and
mill-pond are in an open, sunny pocket of
the woods. The winding lane which leads
in to them is bordered with elms and willows,
and the road is soft underfoot with bark and
sawdust. Feathery elms stand all about the
stream’s basin, and after you have followed the
road in you reach the weather-stained mill, the
logs, the new-cut lumber, as fragrant as can
be, and the great heap of bright-colored sawdust.
Worromontogus drains the pond of
the same name, five miles long, some distance
back in the country.

<h1>CHAPTER IX—MARY GUILFOYLE</h1>
<p>
&#160;<br />
</p>
<p>
The sun had come out bright after a rain,
and every leaf was shining, the June day
when we drove over to Ridgefield to fetch
Mary Guilfoyle. We started early in the
morning, but it was already like noon in that
midsummer season. Daisies were powdering
the fields, as white as snow, and yellow and
orange hawkweeds were growing in among
them, so that whole fields showed yellow,
orange, and white. The orange hawkweed is
very fragrant, and its sweetness mixed with
the spicy bitterness of the daisies. Then, on
a knoll as the road rose above the river, we
found patches of bright blue lupins in the
yellow and orange and white, making such a
blaze of color as I have never seen before
in our northern fields.
</p>
<p>
There were streaks of crimson sorrel in
the fields where there were no daisies, among
the ripening June-grass and red-top; all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95'></a>95</span>
the grasses, and the fields of grain, were beginning
to turn a little tawny, and quick
waves chased each other across them with
the light summer wind.
</p>
<p>
Mary lives in a scrap of a new house, in a
thick wood of young firs and spruces. The
last mile of our road led through these sweet-smelling
trees, which were set all over with
light green jewels of new growth. Grass
grew in the ruts, and the moist earth of the
wood road was thronged with yellow butterflies;
and tiny “blues,” like bits of the sky
come to life, fluttered among the ferns.
Breath after breath of sweetness came from
the warm woods in the sunshine.
</p>
<p>
Mary was waiting for us at the door, with
her knitting in her hand, and her cat at her
skirts. Her small rough fields across the road
were ploughed and planted, and she was ready
to come to us. She is a strongly built old
woman with bright blue eyes and yellowish
gray hair, sturdy as a weather-beaten piece
of white-oak timber. Many is the time that
she has left our house of an afternoon (in our
impossible spring going, too, with the frost
coming out of the ground and the mud a foot
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96'></a>96</span>
deep); walked out to her farm, six full miles,
seen to some detail of farm-work that worried
her, and walked back, arriving before seven
the next morning, to cook our breakfast.
</p>
<p>
She works on her farm all summer, planting
and hoeing her corn and beans and potatoes.
She has help from the men of the neighborhood
when she can get it, but I believe she
follows the plough herself when she is put to
it. In winter she comes into town, and works
for households in difficulties. If the cook
deserts us, or we have a sudden influx of
guests or everyone has grippe, we send for
Mary Guilfoyle and she sees us through. She
comes into a house like a blast of clear air.
Nothing ruffles her, and her mere presence
seems to return its right proportions and
gayety to life. She knows how to work as
few people do nowadays, and she is so sound-hearted
and unafraid that there is something
royal and powerful about her.
</p>
<p>
Mary’s mother was French, and it is from
her she gets her gestures. Her hands move
finely, with a dignity and control a duchess
might envy, and they say more than mere
words could. And then, her funny expressions!
She is a Roman Catholic, but so far
from being a church-goer that I was surprised,
last Easter morning, at seeing her
ready for church; and my surprise was rebuked
with,
</p>

<span class='caption'>PLOUGHING MARY’S FIELD</span>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97'></a>97</span></div>
<p>
“Child, the heretic and the hangman go
to church on this morning!”
</p>
<p>
Her speech is unlike anybody else’s. Every
sentence is vivid, but they lose their quaint
flavor in telling. She is delighted (she is a
fine cook), but excited, too, at getting a
“company meal,” and loses her appetite.
</p>
<p>
“The cook cannot eat, not if she were at
the gates of heaven, at these times,” she
puts it.
</p>
<p>
She was telling one day of an unfortunate
young farm neighbor—
</p>
<p>
“He knelt on a nail, and took lock-jaw.
They hoisted him to Portland, but it warn’t
of no use. He died in four days. He was a
beautiful young man. Warn’t it terrible?”
</p>
<p>
Somehow I never fail to see the poor youth
caught up in a sheet and swung through the
air the whole journey.
</p>
<p>
Mary was born and brought up in the
Catholic community at Ridgefield; but she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98'></a>98</span>
has spent little time there. Fifty-five years
ago, when she was sixteen, she learned fine
sewing and clear-starching at the Great
House of our neighborhood, and then nothing
would do but she must seek her fortune in
Boston, where she already had two sisters
in service. She made the voyage in a sailing
vessel, a small brig laden with hay. She
found out the name of a first-rate dressmaker,
in Temple Place; next she bought a piece of
fine gray cashmere, and cut and made herself
a jacket and dress. Then she presented herself.
</p>
<p>
“How do I know you are a seamstress at
all?” the dressmaker asked.
</p>
<p>
“I cut and made every stitch I have on
me.”
</p>
<p>
“You may go right upstairs, at seven dollars
a week, with the others.”
</p>
<p>
A sweep of the hand illustrated the triumph;
seven dollars was fine pay in those
days.
</p>
<p>
One of her sisters was cook for many
years for Oliver Wendell Holmes.
</p>
<p>
(“A little man, the face wrinkled”—and
Mary’s eloquent hands made me see the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99'></a>99</span>
Doctor again in person.) He took care of her
money for her; and Mary has often told
me how one day, after many years, he said,
</p>
<p>
“Now, Anna, you are a rich woman; you
need never work again, and can do what you
like.”
</p>
<p>
She bought a nice little house in one of
the suburbs.
</p>
<p>
“But a year was all she could stand of it.
She couldn’t make out to live, away from the
Holmeses, and back she goes to them.”
</p>
<p>
Mary married at twenty, and lived quietly
in Chelsea for five and twenty years. Then
her husband died, and instead of going home
to the farm, or staying on where she was, to
take boarders, this born adventurer was off
to see the world.
</p>
<p>
“I hadn’t seen, not one thing, cooped up
there in Chelsea. I wanted to find out about
new things, and new places, whilst I was
strong.”
</p>
<p>
She took a part of her savings, sewed up in
the front of her gown, to fall back on, but
her capable hands were the real funds on
which she depended. She traveled to Denver,
and there went out to service, and afterwards
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100'></a>100</span>
worked in a restaurant. She found light
work in plenty, and in between jobs took her
heart’s fill of sight-seeing. She saw Pike’s
Peak and the Grand Canyon. By the end
of the winter she had earned enough to take
her to San Francisco. Here she had a sister-
and brother-in-law who ran a good restaurant,
and Mary joined forces with them. A year
brim-full of life followed, but after this her
two own sisters, her only surviving near relations,
fell ill, and she came home to nurse
them. It was then that she bought her farm,
near her old home in Ridgefield, planning that
the three should spend their old age together.
Both sisters, though, died; but my indomitable
Mary keeps the farm almost as well as
a man could, and her strong nature, tremendously
intent on the present moment,
never feels loneliness.
</p>
<p>
As I said, she is not much of a church-goer,
but she is devout in her own way, and plans
to go back to San Francisco, to the convent
where a cousin of hers is now Abbess, and
there
</p>
<p>
“Get ready to die; and a good thing to do,
too, first-rate!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101'></a>101</span>
</p>
<p>
I never knew anyone so indifferent about
dress as Mary; she is quite pretty in her way,
and must always have been so, but she
puts on whatever is nearest at hand, and will
hamper her least. It is a fact that I saw her
out in the rain the other day, taking in clothes
from the line, with a length of brown oil-cloth
tied about her stout person, by way of
an apron, with marline, and an empty
shredded-wheat box, split up on one side, on
her head for a hat.
</p>
<p>
The lower meadows were still yellow with
the gold of buttercups as we drove home,
and where the swales ran lower and richer
we saw tall Canada Lilies, Loose-strife, and
purple and white fringed orchids, in among
the Meadow-rue, and light green ferns and
ripening grasses. There was Blue-eyed
Grass, too, and Iris. It was all rich and
fragrant, and butterflies were hovering about
the lilies; and as if this were not enough, a
breath of woodsy sweetness, much like the
fragrance of Lady’s Slippers, met us from a
mixed meadow and cranberry bog, and there
were flocks of rose-pink Arethusas all delicately
poised among the grasses.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102'></a>102</span>
</p>
<p>
Meadow-larks were rising all about, singing
their piercingly sweet notes. The children
were picking wild strawberries, and the blackberries
flung out long springing sprays down
the perfected June roadways. Their blossoms
are very like small single sweet-briar roses.

<h1>CHAPTER X—TRESUMPSCOTT POND</h1>
<p>
&#160;<br />
</p>
<p>
Tresumpscott Pond lies three miles eastward
from our river, set deep between the
folds of wooded and rocky hills, and the
woods frame it close.
</p>
<p>
You climb the rise of a long slow-mounting
hill which at its southern extremity breaks
sharply down in granite ledges, mostly pine-covered,
and there right below you lies this
little lonely, perfectly guarded lake. There
is only one opening in the woods, a farm
which slopes down to the shore in two wide
fields, with a low rambling farmhouse. There
is no other roof in sight.
</p>
<p>
The pond is about a mile long and half as
wide. It has the attributes of a big lake, in
little; deep bays up which loons nest, and
wooded headlands, ending in smooth abrupt
rocks which enclose small curved beaches of
white sand, as firm and fine as sea sand.
The western bay ends in a river of swamp,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104'></a>104</span>
and all along the north side the wood screens
a broken wall of fern-grown cliffs, with quantities
of columbines among their crannies.
The long slope above the woods is a sheep
pasture, partly under pines and partly open,
with ledge and cinquefoil-covered boulders
cropping out in the close turf, and tall
mulleins standing all about like candlesticks.
</p>
<p>
The whole locality is rich in treasures, and
here on the north side of the pond is a stretch
of mossy glades and openings in the underwood
which are covered with the fairy elegance
of maiden-hair fern, the delicate black
stems standing out against the rocks and
moss. They grow under cool rich woods,
with pink Lady’s Slippers scattered in clumps
among them.
</p>
<p>
The farm at Tresumpscott is an ample one,
and Jacob Damren, who farms it, comes of
fine stock, and is a big, hearty figure of a
man. The Pond was his father’s before him.
His wife is a plain little woman, always
clean and trim in fresh cotton print. They
say her habitual sadness is because she has
never liked the Pond. She was town-bred, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105'></a>105</span>
finds it utterly lonely, while to Jacob it holds
everything that earth can give.
</p>
<p>
The land is very fertile and they prospered
till well past middle life, when Jacob met with
an accident that was hard to bear. A neglected
cut on his thumb became infected,
and soon there was swelling and pain in the
whole hand. No one did the right thing, no
one knew what to do beyond the old-fashioned
farm treatments, and after a week of
fever the arm had to go. They said it was
only his wife’s despairing weeping which
brought him at last to consent to amputation.
At first he begged to be allowed to die sooner
than face life again thus maimed.
</p>
<p>
He met the blow, once it fell, in a steady
manly way, and now has come well out
from under its shadow. A month ago I saw
him out with his horse and drag, getting out
stumps, and he was managing this troublesome
business successfully. He smiled a
patient, slow smile, as we came up.
</p>
<p>
“This comes kind of awkward for a one-armed
man!” he called out, but spoke
cheerily, and seemed delighted at the way he
was achieving his stumping.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106'></a>106</span>
</p>
<p>
They have had other troubles. A son who
lived at home and shared the farm, married
a shallow, heartless girl, who left him, and
so broke his heart and his whole hold on life
that he could not bear the place without her,
and has led a wandering, broken sort of existence
since. Their other boy, though, is a
good son indeed. He is part owner in a small
cooperage and he drives over from week to
week, puts in solid help on the farm, and
brings his wife and babies to make cheerful
Sundays for the old people.
</p>
<p>
Jacob and his wife love animals. The last
time I was over there the cosset lamb came
into the kitchen to ask for milk. Mrs. Damren
was caressing two new red calves as if they
were kittens, while Flora, Jacob’s foxhound,
and her two velvet-skinned, soft-eyed puppies
played round them.
</p>
<p>
We drive over to the pond from time to time
for swamp treasures of different kinds. Jacob
has a tumble-down, lichen-covered boathouse
where water-pewees and white-bellied swallows
nest, in which he keeps a few of the worst
boats in the world (with ash oars shaped like
flattened poles and heavy as lead), and lets
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107'></a>107</span>
them out to people who come for pickerel or
water-lilies. The whole western end of the
pond is a laughing expanse of water-lilies and
yellow Beaver Lilies, with the bright yellow
butterfly-shaped blossoms of bladderwort in
among them. Beyond these you come to a
mixture of floating islands, tussocks, intricate
channels of black water, and stretches of
shaking cotton grass, which in June and July
hide a host of slim-stemmed rose-colored
swamp orchids, <em>Arethusa</em>, <em>calopogon</em>, and
<em>pogonia</em>. You pole and shove your boat
between the floating islands, submerging orchids
and cotton-grasses alike in the black
peat water, and beyond them reach the parti-colored
velvet of the peat bog itself.
</p>
<p>
Balsam fir grows here, sweet rush and
sweet gale, and quantities of Labrador Tea,
with shining dark leaves (of which Thoreau
made tea when camping on Chesuncook) and
masses of delicate-stamened white flowers,
which give out a warm resinous sweetness.
All around there is the general bog fragrance
of sphagnum and water-lilies, and the woodsy
perfume of the rose-colored orchids.
</p>
<p>
Farther in shore, among the balsam firs,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108'></a>108</span>
the growth dwindles to a general velvety
richness of gem-like green and crimson
mosses, blueberries, and cranberries and
huckleberries, the large handsome maroon-crimson
flowers of the Pitcher-Plant, and the
little bright-yellow-flowered Sundew, getting
its nourishment from the insects caught in its
sticky crimson filaments.
</p>
<p>
The pond is alive all summer with butterflies
and birds. We spent a day there in June,
and tried to follow a pair of Carolina rails,
which ran and hid among the cotton-grasses,
and ran again, and suddenly vanished as completely
as if they had melted in air. We put
up a bittern, but did not find her nest. Scores
of red-wing black-birds had nested in the clustered
bushes of the floating islands. We laid
our oars down on the shaking cotton grass
as a sort of bridge and worked our way from
island to island, while a perfect cloud of birds
chuckled and wheeled round us, uttering
their guttural warning cries and their fresh
“Hock-a-lees!” We looked into three red-wings’
nests, and one king-bird’s, all with
eggs. The red-wing’s eggs were pale blue,
scratched and blotched with black as if by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109'></a>109</span>
a child playing with ink and pen, while the
king-bird’s were a beautiful cream-color,
marked in a circle round the large end with
rich brown blotches.
</p>
<p>
As we went on to gather Pitcher-Plants and
Sundew, we saw an eagle fishing over the
lonely little lake; saw, too, a thing I have
never seen before or since, for he caught a
fish so big it pulled him under. He vanished
out of sight completely, came up with a great
flap, and, making heavy work of it, and flying
so low he almost touched the water, he made
off and gained the woods with his prize.
</p>
<p>
Besides our orchids and pitcher-plants (we
washed the pitchers clear of insects, and
drank from them), we had come for stickle-backs,
which are found in the clear shallows
by one of the small beaches. We had a net,
and glass jars. They are such quick darting
creatures that it is hard to get them. They
are the liveliest of all pets for an aquarium,
and prosper very fairly in captivity.
</p>
<p>
Early in the morning, when we first reached
the pond, the bobolinks were rising and singing
all over the lower water meadows, and
the mists were turning to silver in the early
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110'></a>110</span>
sunlight. When we came up from the bog
in the late afternoon the bobolinks were silent,
but a mother sand-peep wheeled and cried
about the field, afraid that we would find her
chickens.
</p>
<p>
We cooled our hands and faces in the clear
water and washed off the black peat mold,
and went up to the farm. Mrs. Damren had
fresh gingerbread for us, and creamy milk,
and we sat round a table with a cheerful red
cloth. The room was very homelike, with a
good deal of dark wood, and bright pots and
pans. A shot-gun and a rifle hung over the
mantel, the guns poor Jacob will never use
again. His hunting dog sat close to his chair.
</p>
<p>
The wife’s sorrowful eyes turned always
to her husband, but seemed at the same time
to try to guard his empty sleeve from our
glances. He, with a larger patience, was
unconscious of it.
</p>
<p>
They told us a good thing; that two lads,
sons of a minister in a neighboring town,
have built a little camp in Jacob’s woods.
They come over often to spend the night, and
sometimes stay a week, and are great company.
They come to Jacob for milk, butter,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111'></a>111</span>
and eggs, and often spend the evening. The
week before they had shot two coons, and
they are busy mounting them, under his
directions.
</p>
<p>
Jacob’s face has a great peace in it, that
of a man who has given everything in him
to the place he lives in, and held nothing back.
His beautiful, lonely little holding of wood
and field and lake is better, for the work he
has put into it, than when his father left it to
him. He has cleared more fields, enriched the
land, and drained the lower meadows. His
son will have it after him. I have seldom seen
a place which seemed more entirely home.
</p>
<p>
Jacob had cut the hay in his upper meadow
early (he has to take his son’s or a neighbor’s
help when he can get it), and it was already
piled in sweet-smelling haycocks as we drove
by, but the water meadows, where the purple
fringed orchids and loosestrife grow in
among the grasses, were still uncut. It was
dusk, and the fireflies were out. Thousands
of them flashed their soft radiance low over
the perfumed meadow, and the fragrance of
sweet rush and of the open water came to
us from the lake.

<h1>CHAPTER XI—IN THE TRESUMPSCOTT WOODS</h1>
<p>
&#160;<br />
</p>
<p>
The population of a district can never be
classified. Once again, “folks are folks,” and
the smallest hamlet shows infinite variety. Yet
here and there the individual quality of a
neighborhood seems as marked as that of the
different belts and communities of trees which
clothe the land about it.
</p>
<p>
Watson’s Hill, Ridgefield, and Weir’s Mills
are fine up-standing neighborhoods, with good
houses, big barns, fresh paint, and bright milk
cans catching the sun; but in near-by folds of
the hills, where the ridges slope up into higher
country, there are poor and scattered farms
and farmhouses which are no more than
shanties. A neighborhood six miles from a
big town may be more rustic than another
twice as far. It is partly the soil, partly inheritance,
and surely it is a third part influence.
The land of our Silvester’s Mills
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113'></a>113</span>
Quakers is not specially good, but the impulse
imparted by three or four industrious
good families is the foundation of its marked
prosperity.
</p>
<p>
A Swede and an Italian have lately taken
up two farms which were considered quite
run out, one in North Ridgefield, six miles
from us, and the other at the top of a long
hill on the Tresumpscott Road.
</p>
<p>
The Swede asked William Pender, a thin,
vague, grumbling man, of whom he hired
the land,
</p>
<p>
“How long time to clear these fields of
stones?”
</p>
<p>
“Ninety-nine years!” said William solemnly.
But the Swede, a fair, strong-built
man named Jansen, went to work, with his
wife and his three children. They put on
leather aprons, and worked early and late,
in every spare minute that could be taken
from planting and cultivating. (William
looked on, from his brother’s farm, whither
he had retreated, in a mixture of incredulity,
disapprobation and envy.) <em>They worked in
the rain</em>; and now, after three years, the farm
is clear of stones, and Jansen owns it clear.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114'></a>114</span>
He has a thousand hens, and sells his eggs
and broilers at fancy prices in New York;
and Mrs. Jansen’s lawn and flower-beds are
as gay as those of a neat farm in Holland.
</p>
<p>
The Italian farmer is a larger pattern of
man. He came here as a young fellow with
no better start than a push-cart, but he came
of good intelligent Tuscan people, and has
not only endless industry, but wits to see, and
enterprise to take, all sorts of chances. He did
not take any chances, though, when he married
Alice Farrell, the daughter of one of our
best farmers, a strong pretty girl, as industrious
as her husband, and even more intelligent,
with a free sort of outlook, and something
kindling about her. Her husband is
now the big man of his neighborhood. The
district goes by his name, and he has represented
it in the Legislature. He owns a
fine herd of registered Guernseys, and his
apples bring fancy prices.
</p>
<p>
A friend of mine, a farmer, once asked one
of the great Connecticut nurserymen to what
he attributed the success of the Italians in
nursery work and truck farming. The older
man’s eyes twinkled.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115'></a>115</span>
</p>
<p>
“I’ll tell you,” he said. “They’re willing
to work in the rain!”
</p>
<p>
Our farm conditions are improving, almost
while you watch them. The Agricultural Department
of the State University is doing
yeoman service. People are beginning to
realize what science is bringing to agriculture,
and the young men are fired by it. They are
especially beginning to realize what ignorance
it was to leave so many farms deserted, and
to condemn so much of the land as hopeless
and used up. The friend who asked the question
about the Italians said of our own farmers:
</p>
<p>
“They stick to their grandfathers’ ways,
and not to their grandfathers’ enterprise and
ambition for improvement.” But this statement
is fast coming to be untrue.
</p>
<p>
Interspersed, however, among the prosperous
districts there are curious, backward hamlets,
where the woods seem to encroach.
Their hills shut them about too closely. Some
set of the tide of human affairs, some change
of transportation or of market, cuts off the
wholesome currents of life from them, and
they stagnate like cut-off water and become
degenerate.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116'></a>116</span>
</p>
<p>
There is a sad combination of receding
prosperity and a run-out population in a town
a long day’s drive from us. Poor place, it has
become bankrupt. Its timber was cut off, and
the cooperages, on which its tiny livelihood
depended, moved away. Its farms straggle
up the flanks of a round-topped mountain.
Apple-raising might perhaps have saved it,
but either such of its people as had the enterprise
for this moved away, or it possessed
none such. The people I saw there looked
as different as possible from our hearty sun-and-air
neighbors. Unkempt faces thronged
the dirty windows of farms that were mere
shacks. They looked at once ambitionless and
sinister. “Merricktown folks,” people of the
neighboring districts say, when tools disappear
or robes are stolen from the sleighs
at a Grange supper.
</p>
<p>
No Indians are left in our part of the world;
but here and there a family shows marked
traces of Indian blood, as old Sile Taylor,
beyond Watson’s Hill, a frowsy and hospitable
patriarch, whose little black eyes twinkle
with a kind of foxy kindliness. Though none
dwell here, Indians come two or three
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117'></a>117</span>
times a year from the State Reservation,
with snow-shoes, moccasins, and sweet-grass
baskets to sell. They make a yearly pilgrimage
to the seashore for the sweet-grass, which
grows in the salt meadows at the mouths of
a few rivers. They cut and dry it, and carry
home many hundred pounds for the winter’s
weaving. The Gabriel brothers, Joe and Bill,
are regular visitors among us, enormous dark
men, with that Indian habit of silence which
implies not so much taciturnity, as a certain
tranquil quality. Tranquillity and kindness
seem to flow from the big brothers. They
seem untroubled by any need of speech.
</p>
<p>
Then beyond Rattlesnake Hill there are the
“Jingroes.” They are credited with being
pure-blooded gipsies, and they certainly look
it. I do not know whether they started with
a definite Mr. and Mrs. Jingroe or not. The
name is applied to the whole tribe. They
live “over back,” in clearings in a wide belt
of forest. They are perfectly indolent, but
cheerful, and content with the most primitive
farming.
</p>
<p>
Once in a while, when things go hard with
them, they all set to work, and weave very
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118'></a>118</span>
good baskets, which they bring in town to
sell. You are met at every street corner by
handsome, dark-eyed Mrs. Jingroes, in kerchief
and bright earrings, importuning every
passer-by to buy a basket.
</p>
<p>
About once a year a gipsy caravan drives
through our town, and stops in the street
on its way. The slim, handsome barefooted
children and their dark square-built mothers
are all about. The women bustle from shop
to shop, making small purchases, and pick up
a little money by telling fortunes.
</p>
<p>
Once, when the gipsies camped in a rough
pasture near town, one of the children died,
and a touching deputation came, to ask permission
(which was of course given) to bury
it in the town cemetery.
</p>
<p>
Another time, as a caravan drove through
the town, I noticed a girl lying at the back
of one of the flimsy, covered wagons, so ill
she seemed to be unconscious. She was a
lovely creature, dark and pale, and her slim
body swayed and shook with the shaking of
the wheels. I wanted to call out to the
drivers to stop, but the crazy caravan rattled
away at a half-canter, and paid no attention.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119'></a>119</span>
</p>
<p>
Tresumpscott Pond lies in the midst of our
most heavily forested district. There is no
village or hamlet near it, but a handful of
little farms, on tiny clearings or no clearings
at all, are scattered through the woods.
</p>
<p>
The dwellers in these forest farms are not
people of substance, like the farmers of the
open country near them, but they are intelligent
folk, and are rich in the treasure of a
varied and interesting life. The men of the
family are sure to have hunting coats and
gaiters,—leather or canvas; good guns, which
they keep well oiled and bright; and most of
them keep a good fox hound or two, whose
jubilant music may be heard as they range
through the winter woods with their masters,
or on independent hunting excursions. The
boys begin by seven years old to have trapping
enterprises of their own up the little
quick forest brooks, and what looks to the
ordinary person like the merest mossy runnel,
hardly a brook at all, may be well known
as a drinking-place of coons, or a haunt where
sharp eyes may see a mink. They are sent out
to gather thoroughwort, dill, dock, and other
simples, and mosses and roots for the farm
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120'></a>120</span>
dyeing. (<em>Cruttles</em>, or <em>crottles</em>, the farm name
for the dark moss growing on ash-trees, makes
a fine yellow dye.) They know where to lie
hidden at half past three in the morning
on the chance of seeing a deer, and under
which stretch of lily-pads is the best chance
for a pickerel. And not only the boys: I
know a girl on a farm, whose grown-up
brother has such confidence in her marksmanship,
that he will shake an apple-tree, while
she nicks the falling apples with her rifle.
They make use of a far greater number of
wild plants than are known to the farmers
of the more open country, as “greens,” cooking
and eating young milk-weed stalks, shepherd’s
purse, and the uncurling fronds of the
<em>Osmundas</em> and other great ferns, which they
call “fiddle-heads.”
</p>
<p>
They grow up sinewy and alert, under this
eager life, and the best of them attain, beside
their farm knowledge, to the undefinable
huntsman’s knowledge, which sets its mark
on a man. Their bearing is confident and
fearless, and with it they have a certain forest
quality on which it is hard to lay a finger.
It is noticeable that the greater part of the
families who cleave to this forest way of life
are apt to be of dark complexion. It is a great
pity that most of them can get so little
schooling, but they have all been educated,
since they were little, in a training which
certainly develops and intensifies some of
man’s best powers.

</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121'></a>121</span></div>
<p>
The deep tranquil woods cover the rise
and fall of the ridges for a good stretch of
miles, and a good deal of hunting and trapping
is to be had in them. Last month we
came on fresh raccoon tracks, like prints of
little hands, in the leaf mould of the wood
road, and coons are often shot here. One
day, as we were walking, there was a great
growling and barking from our dogs, and
we found that they had treed a porcupine.
</p>
<p>
In my Grandfather’s time, sheep had to
be driven at night to the tops of the hills,
because of the bears in the Tresumpscott
woods; and only two years ago there was an
outcry among the farmers because sheep were
being killed. Everybody watched his neighbor’s
dog, but Oliver Newcomb, who lives on
a little farm in the heart of the forest tract,
coming home at dusk up the wood road,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122'></a>122</span>
heard a growling and snarling, and came on
a great Bay Lynx, the only one seen in this
part of the country for many years. Oliver
is a man who is almost never seen without
his gun, and he shot the marauder, and got
twenty-five dollars for the skin, a real windfall
for a young man on a small forest farm,
with wife to keep and five children. The skin
was mounted, and set up in the library of the
Soldiers’ Home.
</p>
<p>
The Bay Lynx is a much longer, more
panther-like creature than our common
Canada Lynx (the <em>Loup Cervier</em> or Bob-cat),
and is of a general bay color, not unlike that
of the Mountain Lion of the West. I have
wondered if this might not be the panther
or “painter” which was the terror of our
Northern woods to early settlers.
</p>
<p>
“Big Game” has increased greatly in our
State of late years, partly from the enforcement
of strict game laws, partly because the
wolves have nearly all been killed off. Deer
are so common as to be a menace to crops
in some places, and there are at least three
thriving beaver colonies in our part of the
State.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123'></a>123</span>
</p>
<p>
In 1868 my father, driving on a fishing trip
through a town sixty-five miles north of us,
was shown a pair of blanched moose antlers,
set up over the sign-post at the cross-roads.
</p>
<p>
“Look at that well,” the stage driver said.
“That’s a sight you’ll never see again, not
in this State!”
</p>
<p>
To-day, as every hunter knows, moose are
plentiful, all through the two-thirds of the
State that lies under forest; and not only
there, for this very autumn three have been
seen in the Tresumpscott woods, while both
last year and this, a black bear has spent several
weeks in our neighborhood.
</p>
<p>
Muskrat are found in Tresumpscott Pond
and its small tributary streams, hares and
partridges and foxes all through its woods.
Black duck, and sometimes wood duck, breed
about the Pond, and Carolina rails; and
where the brooks that feed the Pond spread
out into broad estuaries of alder covert, you
may see the marked flight of snipe or woodcock.
</p>
<p>
It was in these woods that Jerome Mitchell,
our local authority on game and fur (a very
fair naturalist, also), grew up. He is a slender,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124'></a>124</span>
well-knit fellow, whose mother had great ambitions
for him. He walked into town, five
miles and back, every day, to get one year in
the High School, after his country schooling.
He could not afford any more, but when he
was seventeen, having picked up a knowledge
of taxidermy and simple mechanics, he moved
into town. He worked early and late with
dogged patience, taking every smallest job
that offered, till at last he realized his ambition,
and opened a small, but good sportsmen’s
and general repair shop. Gradually
he picked up the fur trade of the neighborhood.
He is anxiously fair, and boys from
the farms soon began to bring in skunk, squirrel,
and muskrat skins, and every little while
a fox or a coon.
</p>
<p>
Last year Jerome ran into hard luck. A
stranger, a good-looking man, brought in an
extra fine looking lot of muskrat skins.
There were $600 worth, and this was a low
figure for them. It was a serious venture,
still Jerome took them; they turned out, however,
to be stolen goods, and he had to pay
the rightful owner, as the stranger was nowhere
to be found. Poor Jerome! he was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125'></a>125</span>
near tears when he told my father about it.
Then, when he just had his store new painted
and set in order for the summer’s trade, someone
dropped a lighted match among the shavings,
and the whole stock and fixtures were
in a blaze.
</p>
<p>
This loss turned out to be not so serious.
Jerome worked nearly all night for a week,
and made better fittings than he had had
before. The wholesale dealers were generous,
and the shop re-opened with the best outfit
of goods that it has had at all.
</p>
<p>
Now a good windfall has come to him. A
rural mail-carrier brought word of a silver fox
which had been trapped on a farm fifteen miles
out in the country. Jerome only waited to
telegraph to a big fur dealer for whom he
works, who has lately established a fox farm,
and started off at once. He found even better
than he had hoped. The fox was a perfect
young male, coal black, and hardly scratched
by the trap.
</p>
<p>
In the recent craze over fox-raising, as much
as ten thousand dollars has been paid, in our
State, for a first-rate black fox. Of course
Jerome would only get a commission, but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126'></a>126</span>
this was the first big chance that had come
to him and he was beside himself with
anxiety lest it miscarry. It was a sharp
February night, but he slept in the barn
beside his prize, and the next morning drove
home, dreading every drift and thank-you-ma’am,
for fear they might upset, and
the slight crate that held the fox might
break.
</p>
<p>
That night he slept on the floor of his
shop, wrapping himself in the sleigh robes.
The fox ate the meat given him with a good
appetite, and curled up contentedly enough
to sleep; but as the first grayness began to
show before dawn, he stood up, bristling a
little, and barked, a far-away, lonely sound,
Jerome said. The next day he was forwarded
to the dealer in safety.
</p>
<p>
My father has shot and hunted all about
this region, going on snow-shoes after foxes
and hares in winter, with one of the forest
farmers—generally one of the Huntingtons—as
guide or companion; coming into the warm
dark farm kitchen for a warm-up before the
long ride or drive home. The Huntingtons
always had good dogs. Bugle, a fox-hound
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127'></a>127</span>
famous through the countryside, belonged to
them.
</p>
<p>
John Huntington is the man whom neither
bee nor wasp will sting. He is sent for all
about to take away troublesome hornets’
nests, which he simply tears down and pulls
to pieces with his bare hands. Some hornets
built a huge nest over the door of the
stable at the Homestead not long ago, just
where the men come and go for milking.
One of the farm men wanted to take a torch
and smoke it out, but Thomas Burnham, the
farmer in charge, sent all the way over to
Tresumpscott for John Huntington. He
came, a silent, dark, shambling man; looked
at the nest, nodded, asked for a ladder,
climbed up, and unconcernedly pulled the
whole thing down, while the furious hornets
swarmed over his uncovered face and hands.
He reached a finger down his neck, first on one
side, then the other, and took out handfuls of
them, and scraped them off where they had
crawled up his sleeves. He tore the nest up,
threw it on the ground, and stamped on it, and
with few words went back to his farm.
</p>
<p>
I have never heard any adequate explanation
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128'></a>128</span>
of this phenomenon. Some people say
that persons having this power have a distinctive
odor about them, which wasps and
bees dislike, and others ascribe it only to an
entire fearlessness and unconcern.
</p>
<p>
Sam Huntington, John’s younger brother, is
a handsome, strong, slender-built fellow, taller
than John and even darker. It was Sam who
showed my father, one day out snipe shooting,
what a <em>bee line</em> really means, and how to take
one, and find the bee-tree. You catch two
wild bees, and attach a bit of cotton wool,
big enough to mark the bee’s flight, to each;
let the first bee go, getting the line of his
flight well, then walk on two or three hundred
yards, and let the second go, taking note
equally carefully. Where the two lines intersect
is the bee-tree and the hidden treasure
of wild honey.
</p>
<p>
Sitting in Jacob Damren’s clover field one
day, my father showed me how to find
bumble-bee honey. We sat still, and watched
the fat bee go his buzzing way from head
to head of red clover. At last he had honey
enough, and off he started on a swifter,
straighter flight, but he was heavy with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129'></a>129</span>
honey, and we could easily follow. He did
not go far, but swung on a long slant to his
hole in the ground. We dug where he entered
(he emerged, part way through the
process, very angry and buzzing) and about
six inches down we found the honey cells.
There was a lump or cluster of them, perhaps
half as big as your hand. They were
longer than the cells of honey bees; not hexagonal
like these, but roughly cylindrical, dark
brown, and full of very good, clear, dark
brown honey.
</p>
<p>
Tresumpscott Pond is a great haunt of
whippoorwills. As dusk begins to fringe the
coverts of the wood, they begin their strange,
almost ghostly chorus, like the swift whistling
of a rod through the air, powerful and regular,
“whip,” and “whip,” and “whip” again,
answering each other all night. I noticed the
time of their first notes, one night in early
July. The voices of the veeries fell away,
and then stopped, at quarter past eight, and
at quarter of nine the first whippoorwill
struck up, and was instantly answered. (I
have known them to begin sharp at eight
o’clock, or even earlier.)
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130'></a>130</span>
</p>
<p>
It is extremely hard to see the birds themselves,
for they lie hid all day in the deep
woods, sleeping. Like owls, they seem unable
to see well if roused by daylight. At
night they gather close about the farms, one
perhaps on the roof of the barn, and one or
two on a fence (sitting always <em>lengthwise</em> to
their perch, never across), and sometimes you
can see their shape silhouetted against the
sky. Last May, a whippoorwill was bewildered
in a sudden gale, and did not get back
to the woods, but spent the day sound asleep
in broad sunlight on the railing of a balcony,
right in the midst of our town. I stood
within four feet of him. He is a strange-shaped
bird, with whiskers like a cat’s, and
a flat head; about the size of a small hawk,
and mottled, like his cousin the night-hawk,
with gray and white markings like those of
rocks and lichens, or of some of the larger
moths.

<h1>CHAPTER XII—HARVEST</h1>
<p>
&#160;<br />
</p>
<p>
In late September an errand took us out to
Sam Marston’s again. We wanted a quantity
of early farm things, sweet cider, Porter
apples, and honey.
</p>
<p>
The woods were in a flame of fiery color
as we drove out through the intricacies of
the river hills. They glowed like beds of
tulips, with only the dark evergreens to
set them off, and turned our whole country
into a huge flower garden.
</p>
<p>
The crops had all been very good this
season. Hay and grain were both heavy, and
the apple trees had to be propped, the
branches were so loaded with fruit. Our own
grapes bore heavily.
</p>
<p>
The early apples were just gathering when
we reached the farm, amongst all sorts of
pleasant orchard sounds, the rumble of apples
poured from bushel baskets into barrels, the
squeak of the cider mill, and the men talking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132'></a>132</span>
at work. The large new orchard of Bellefleurs
is hand-picked, in the modern method;
each apple is wrapped in paper, and the fruit
has its special first-rate market; but Sam is
not going to take his father’s old miscellaneous
orchard in hand until next year, and
here he and his men were picking and piling
in the old wholesale fashion. The sweet-smelling
pyramids stood waist-high under the
trees.
</p>
<p>
Sam scrambled down his ladder, and
shouted to Susan, who came out from her
baking with her hands white with flour. The
last time we came, we had seen only the
house and dairy; now we must see the farm,
and we strolled together through the sunny
orchard and then were taken to the apple
cellar, where the filled barrels stood in close
ranks already. The cellar was fragrant with
them. Susan’s own special apples, Snows,
Strawberries, and Porters, were at one side.
</p>
<p>
“Has to have ’em!” Sam said. “Every
farm book tells you how mixed apples can’t
pay, and hinder the farm, but come Grange
suppers and church suppers, and young folks
happening in, and Fair times, if Susan
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133'></a>133</span>
couldn’t have her mixed fruit, she’d think we
might full as well be at the Town-Farm.”
</p>
<p>
The root cellar, smelling earthy, was next
the apple cellar, and here Sam had a few
beets and carrots, in neat bins, but the greater
part of the roots were still undug.
</p>
<p>
The cider-mill was at the edge of the orchard,
with piles of windfall apples beside
it; Sam turned a fresh jug-full for us to drink,
and then filled our cans.
</p>
<p>
After this we had to see all Susan’s pets.
There were two handsome collies; and a yellow
house cat, and a great black barn cat, on
stiff terms with each other, came and
rubbed against us with arched backs. There
were the ducks and geese, and tumbler
pigeons, fluttering down in great haste when
Susan scattered corn. The newest pet was
a raccoon. He was in the tool-room of the
barn, nibbling corn. He steadied the ear as
he ate, with little hands as careful as a
child’s. He looked sly and mischievous, and
sidled away as we came in, looking up at us
with bright eyes. He wore a little collar, and
dragged a short length of chain, so that the
pigeons could hear him coming; but he was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134'></a>134</span>
not confined in any way, and seemed entirely
happy and at home about the barn.
</p>
<p>
“Pretty fellow, then,” said Susan, scratching
his handsome fur. “But he’s a scamp, he
is. Only to think, what happened to my pies,
last baking! I’d made a quantity, both mince
and pumpkin, and if this rascal doesn’t slip
into the pantry, eat all he can hold, and mark
the rest of the pies all over with his little
hands, and throw them on the floor!”
</p>
<p>
She asked if we had ever seen a raccoon
with a piece of meat. We had not, and she
fetched a bit from the ice chest and gave it to
her pet. He took it in his little hands, went
to his water dish, and <em>washed</em> the meat thoroughly,
sousing it up and down till it was almost
a pulp, before he swallowed it. Susan
said that raccoons, wild or tame, will always
do this, with all animal food; mouse or
mole or grasshopper, they will not touch it
till they have washed it well, and will go
hungry rather than eat unwashed food. Sam,
who knows the woods like the back of his
hand, confirmed this.
</p>
<p>
“Souse it in a brook, they will, till they
have it soggy. They won’t eat it till then.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135'></a>135</span>
</p>
<p>
While we were looking, a morose-looking
old man drove into the yard. He checked his
horse, and sat gazing straight before him
with a wooden expression.
</p>
<p>
“Hullo, Uncle!” said Sam. “Come for
apples?”
</p>
<p>
The old man shook his head, but said
nothing.
</p>
<p>
“Cider?” said Sam.
</p>
<p>
He shook his head also at this, and at every
other suggestion, and never opened his lips.
After a while Sam, who seemed to know his
ways, nodded cheerfully, said, “Well, tell us
when you get ready to!” and turned towards
the house.
</p>
<p>
The old man waited till he had gone twenty
feet, and then said grudgingly:
</p>
<p>
“I come to see that there cow. You finish
with your company! I’ll wait.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s old Ammi Peaslee,” Susan whispered.
“He always acts odd. Oh, no, no
relation; everyone on the road calls him
Uncle: ‘Uncle Batch’ when he’s not
round.”
</p>
<p>
“He didn’t mean to be a batch” (bachelor),
she went on reflectively; and then
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136'></a>136</span>
with some shamefacedness, she told us how
Mr. Peaselee had once been engaged to be
married to Miss Charity Jordan (who lived
alone in the big brick Jordan house at the
corner) for twenty-five long years. One day
the lady’s roof needed shingling, and she
called on her suitor to shingle it. (“She
never could bear to spend money, nor he
either, and it’s a fact that neither one of them
had much to spend!”)
</p>
<p>
He did it, and did a good job; but afterwards,
thinking it but right and fair, he
brought a set of shirts for his sweetheart to
make.
</p>
<p>
“She made them, <em>and she sent him in a bill</em>;
and he paid it, and never spoke to her again
from that day to this, and that is fifteen years
ago.
</p>
<p>
“Now hear me gossip! I am fairly
ashamed!” Susan cried out.
</p>
<p>
The barn was sweet with hay. Part of the
season’s pumpkins were piled in the grain
room, and lit up the dusk with their dark gold.
Some of them still lay in golden piles in the
barn-yard. The ears of corn, yellow and red,
lay in separate heaps.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137'></a>137</span>
</p>
<p>
“I miss Mother!” Susan said (she spoke
of Sam’s mother, who had passed on the
year before). “She saw to all the pretty
things about the farm. She used to hang
the corn in patterns on the ceiling-hooks,
red and yellow. She’d place the onions in
amongst the corn, in ropes or bunches, and
contrive all kinds of pretty notions.”
</p>
<p>
Susan sighed, and called the two collies to
her, and patted and fondled their heads. As
I said before, she and Sam have no children.
</p>
<p>
Sam went to get our honey, saying that
he should be stung to death, and never
mourned for, for nobody missed a left-handed
fellar; and Susan took us into the house, and
brought out doughnuts, a pumpkin pie, and
cream so thick that it could hardly be
skimmed.
</p>
<p>
When Sam came back with the honey there
was a to-do, for Susan’s Jersey calf, outside
in the orchard, had tangled itself in its rope,
and fallen and sprained its shoulder. The
little creature was trembling all over. Susan
rubbed in fresh goose-oil, while Sam asked if
she “didn’t want he should get him up a nice
pair of crutches.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138'></a>138</span>
</p>
<p>
For our cranberries, we were to go on a
mile further, to a farm on the slope of the
next hill, the Pennys’.
</p>
<p>
“The old woman’s deaf, but you can make
her hear by shouting. Most likely she’ll be
the only one of the folks at home. They’re
odd folks,” Susan called, shading her eyes to
look after us, after Sam had succeeded in
packing our purchases in the wagon, laughing
and talking about the way Noah filled
the ark, and Susan had given my little sister
a wistful kiss.
</p>
<p>
The Pennys’ was an out-of-the-way place.
The farm was on the northern slope of a
hill, the house a tiny unpainted one, weathered
almost to black. The corn was standing
among the golden pumpkins in stacks that
looked like huddled witches. A wild grapevine
grew over the shed, but the grapes were
already shriveled.
</p>
<p>
Old Mrs. Penny was shriveled too, and
witch-like, and she was smoking a pipe. It
was hard to make her understand what we
wanted, but at last she came out, with a
checked shawl held over her head, and pointed
out a path which led through a thicket and
across the flank of the hills, to the cranberry
bog in the hollow.
</p>

<span class='caption'>THE CORN WAS STANDING AMONG THE GOLDEN PUMPKINS IN STACKS THAT LOOKED LIKE HUDDLED WITCHES</span>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139'></a>139</span></div>
<p>
Mrs. Penny, Jr., was squatted down among
the swamp mosses, picking cranberries into
sacks. She was a fat Indian-looking woman,
and two dark little girls, pretty, and also like
Indians, with black hair neatly parted, were
at work with her. They were delighted to
sell their berries.
</p>
<p>
The swamp glowed like a Turkey carpet.
The cranberry vines and huckleberry bushes
were pure crimson, the black alder berries
scarlet, and the ferns burnt-orange. Just
beyond us, in the velvet of the swamp, was a
pond, across which the wind ruffled; living
blue, with tawny rushes around it.
</p>
<p>
As we came back, a hunter, in a leather
jacket, with his gun on his shoulder and
partridges hanging out of his pockets, stepped
out of the woods on the path just ahead of
us. This was old Mrs. Penny’s son Jason.
The open season had not begun yet, but the
farm looked a hard place for a living, and
we saw no need of telling, in town, that the
Penny family had partridge for supper.
</p>
<p>
We had a long quiet drive home. It had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140'></a>140</span>
been so extraordinarily warm, all through
early September, that we saw a fine second
crop of hay being got in, in a low-lying
meadow bordered by thick woods, part of
which must have been an old lake-bottom.
The grass was heavy, and a good many fresh
haycocks were made and standing already, as
if in July. The solitary mower rested on his
scythe to watch us, and then went on, though
the dusk was fast deepening.
</p>
<p>
We stopped when we came to Height of
Land, to look out over the painted woods.
They flamed round us to the horizon.
</p>
<p>
Later the moon rose, in the half-blue, half-dusk,
and presently shone on a white mist-lake,
over the low land through which we
were then passing. The mist was rising, and
wreathing the colored woods with white.
Next came two more hills, and then another
mist-lake in the moonlight.

<h1>CHAPTER XIII—WATSON’S HILL</h1>
<p>
&#160;<br />
</p>
<p>
By October of this year the fires of September
had sunk to a rich smouldering glow.
The rolling woods, as far as the eye could
see, were masses of dusky gold and wine-color.
There was actual smoke, too, pale
blue in the hollows, from many forest fires.
</p>
<p>
Nearly all of October was Indian Summer.
Every day there was a soft golden haze, just
veiling the yellow of the woods, and the days
were warm and still, like midsummer, but
with a kind of mellow peacefulness.
</p>
<p>
We spent a whole day out on Watson’s
Hill, watching the distant smoke of forest
fires, and listening to the different Autumn
sounds, the ring of axes from the wooded
part of the hill, an occasional shot, the tapping
of woodpeckers, and the friendly chirruping
of chickadees and juncos. The bare
hill-top was steeped in sunshine. The checkerberries
and beechnuts were just ripe, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142'></a>142</span>
very good. We built our fire on a flat-topped,
lichened rock, and found water to
drink in a little tarn among the russet and
tawny ferns and cotton-grasses, fed by a
spring which stirred and dimpled the surface.
</p>
<p>
Driving home, at dusk, we passed field after
field of Indian Warriors, corn-stacks, all looking
the same way, with golden pumpkins
among them; and suddenly, over the eastern
ridge, the great round yellow Hunter’s Moon
rose.
</p>
<p>
It was strange, later, to see the oaks and
sugar maples, towers of <em>gold</em>, instead of
towers of green, in the moonlight.
</p>
<p>
A few days later we had a three days’
storm of rain and heavy wind, and then the
golden harvest lay on the ground. It was
heaped and piled along the roadsides in winrows,
through which the children scuffed and
frolicked.
</p>
<p>
(The leaves in the town streets are burned,
which is a waste, but if we were so thrifty
as to keep them we should lose the autumn
bonfires. I counted fourteen about the different
streets, one evening, each with a glow
lighting up the dusk, and giving out an
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143'></a>143</span>
indescribable sweet-and-acrid smell as the
smoke poured out in cream-white swirls, almost
thick enough to be felt. The men in
charge of them looked black against the
blaze, and a flock of children were scampering
about each fire.) The day after the rain
the leaves lay all through the woods like a
yellow carpet, and threw up actual light. In
some places they had fallen in lines and patterns,
and, wet with rain and autumn dew,
they gave out fragrance which was as sweet
as wine.
</p>
<p>
Late in October there was sudden illness
at a friend’s house. Every nurse in town was
busy already, and we drove out to see if we
could get Marcia Watson, at Watson’s Hill.
Marcia is not a graduate nurse, but she knows
what a sick woman wants, and what a sick
household, paralyzed by the illness of its
head, must have, and can set the whole
stricken machinery in order again. She is a
tiny creature, as merry as a squirrel, with
quick, tranquil ways.
</p>
<p>
The Watson’s Hill district is six miles east
of us. The Hill is a beech-wooded ridge,
rocky through its whole length, and curving
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144'></a>144</span>
almost enough to suggest an amphitheatre.
A good farming region lies
spread out below it, and there is a village
nucleus, a store, the Grange Hall, and a
meeting-house. The hall was burnt, two
years ago, and the whole neighborhood set
to work to rebuild it. They had fifteen-cent
entertainments and peanut parties, and sales
of aprons and cooked food. The men did the
building, giving their time, and the women
cooked for the men, and this fall the last
shingle of the substantial new building was
laid.
</p>
<p>
The only mill for many miles is the corn-cannery.
Corn-husking always brings farm
neighbors together; sweet corn, for canning,
is husked in August, fodder corn
in late October. Families come to husk
for each other, and the wide barn floors
where they sit are piled high with
husks; but in the districts near a cannery,
as here, the whole community gathers.
In good weather the work is all done out of
doors, and the laughing and chatting groups,
men, women, and children, sit up to their
waists in husks. The stoves and kitchens of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145'></a>145</span>
neighbors are all pre-empted, and the women
bake and fry, and come bustling out to the
workers with milk, bread and cheese, pies and
doughnuts.
</p>
<p>
Here, at Watson’s Hill, as at nearly every
farm village in our part of the world, the
neighbors meet for the weekly dance, which
is as much a matter of course as church on
Sundays. It would be hard to describe adequately
the friendliness and complete sociableness
of these neighborhood gatherings. Old
and middle-aged and young are called by
their first names, and everybody dances; not
round dances, but the beautiful old country
dances, which, transplanted over seas and
carried down a century, still show their quality,
and keep something of the courtly nature
of the great houses in France and England
where they had their stately beginnings: a
quality that gives a certain true social training.
Everyone in the hall is truly in company.
Hands must be given and glances met,
all round the dance, and awkwardness and
shyness are quickly danced out of existence.
</p>
<p>
We have the Lancers, the Tempest, the
Lady of the Lake, and various quadrilles.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146'></a>146</span>
They cannot now perhaps be called exactly
stately.
</p>
<p>
“Balance to partners!” calls out old Abel
Tarbox, master of ceremonies of the Grange
Hall, as he fiddles.
</p>
<p>
“Balance to partner! Swing the same!
All sashy!” And then comes the splendid
romp of,
</p>
<p>
“Eight hands round!” and “Eight hands
down the middle!”
</p>
<p>
Besides the old court dances, there are
Pop Goes the Weasel, Money Musk, Hull’s
Victory, and others, pretty, intricate frolics,
which in their day were the <em>dernier cri</em> of
fashion, danced by gilded youth in great
cities, velvet coat and ruffles, flowered silk
petticoat, and spangled fan.
</p>
<p>
The Chorus Jig is very difficult. It has
“contra-corners,” and other mysteries impossible
to uninitiated feet.
</p>
<p>
When money is to be raised for some
neighborhood purpose partners for the evening
are chosen in what I should think might
be a trying, though a most practical fashion.
On one Saturday evening the ladies, on the
next the gentlemen, are put up for auction
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147'></a>147</span>
as partners, the price paid being in peanuts.
A popular partner will sometimes bring as
much as a hundred and twenty-five peanuts;
and why little Alfred Stoddard, who never
did anything in his life but get a musical
degree at some tiny college (there are even
those who say that he bought the degree), who
reads catalogues and nurses his dignity while
his wife works the farm, should regularly fetch
this fancy price, I never could see.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, well!” says Sam Marston, “Alfred
has them handsome, mournful dark eyes.
The ladies can’t resist ’em.”
</p>
<p>
The three Watson farms lie to the east of
the hill, right under its rocky ledges, and are
sheltered by it; indeed the whole of the beautiful
rounded valley which they occupy is
rimmed entirely by low abrupt hills. It must
be an old lake bottom, for the last remnant
of the lake, a pond a hundred yards or so
long, still sparkles bright blue in the midst
of it.
</p>
<p>
Forty years ago Tristam Watson, with
his wife and four children, three boys, and
Marcia, the youngest, went north two hundred
miles, to the Aroostook, when that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148'></a>148</span>
region still lay under heavy forest. He built
his cabin among the first-growth pines, and
cleared and planted among the trees, burning
and uprooting the stumps gradually, as he
could. It was pioneer life, with no roads and
almost no neighbors. Bear and moose were
common, and deer more than common, and
there were wolves in a hard winter; but he
was a hardy, vigorous man with hardy children,
and he did well.
</p>
<p>
He had no idea of cutting himself and his
family off from their home ties. Nothing of
the sort. The railroad ran only a short part
of the way, and they could not afford that
part, but every year they hitched up and
<em>drove</em> home, the whole distance. It took them
about five days. They had a little home-made
tent, and they built their fire and set up their
gipsy housekeeping each night beside the
road. If it rained, “why then it rained,”
Marcia says. The year was marked by this
flight; it was their great adventure, and
apparently a perfect frolic, at least for the
children. They stayed two or three weeks,
saw all the “folks,” and went back to their
strenuous forest life.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149'></a>149</span>
</p>
<p>
Tristam died at about sixty, and the family
came home, and took up the three beautiful
farms left to the sons by their grandparents.
The two elder sons married, the third stayed
with his mother and sister.
</p>
<p>
Not long after they came back, Marcia fell
ill. There was a badly aggravated strain, and
she had measles and bronchitis, and after that,
as we say in the country, she “commenced
ailing.” She changed in a year from a blooming
girl to the little thin, white-faced woman
she is now (though her black eyes never
stopped twinkling).
</p>
<p>
A long illness on an isolated farm is a bad
thing for more than bodily health. The
Rural Free Delivery and Rural Telephone,
and the lengthening trolley lines, are bringing
the most wholesome stir imaginable after the
old colorless days; but in old times the outlying
farms too often held pitiful brooding
figures of women, sunk in depression. Marcia’s
terror was lest she should fall under this
shadow. She had seen only too many such
cases, and the fear was beginning to realize itself,
she often has told me; but from its very
danger her mind, fundamentally sane and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150'></a>150</span>
vigorous, plucked out its salvation. First
absorbed in her own ailments, she began to
question her doctor about the cure of other
diseases. Soon she asked him for books on
medicine. She read and studied, and then one
day she asked him to take her to see a suffering
neighbor. To humor her, he did, and
almost at once, ill as she still was, she began
to help nursing patients on the neighboring
farms. Once her mind took hold of work, it
cleared itself as the sky clears of clouds
when the wind blows. It was like a slender
but vigorous-fibred little tree reaching out
and finding life-giving soil for itself. I do
not believe she has an ounce of extra strength,
even now, and she is by no means always free
from pain, but she can do her work, and for
five years she has been the most sought-after
nurse in half the county.
</p>
<p>
She has an imp’s fun (and had, even when
she was most ill) and can make a groaning
patient laugh, as she lays on hot compresses.
As we drove home that day in October, she
told me how she had been outwitting her
brother. (He is a handsome blond-bearded
fellow, with what is rare on the farms, a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151'></a>151</span>
carriage as erect as a soldier’s. He is far
slower-natured than Marcia.)
</p>
<p>
“He’s been real tardy, this year, in getting
the hams smoked, and he put off building a
smoke-house. He was all for hauling his lumber.
Nothing would do but that lumber must
be hauled first, whether the pigs were smoked,
or whether they flew; and there were Mother
and I in want of our bacon.”
</p>
<p>
He started out with the lumber. The moment
his back was turned Marcia pounced on
his brand-new chicken coop (“he fusses like
a woman buying a bonnet, over his chicken
coops”), which was just finished and right,
and smoked the meat for herself.
</p>
<p>
“That man was fairly annoyed!” she told
me demurely.
</p>
<p>
Last spring the brother and sister shingled
the barn roof together. Leonard, the brother,
was deliberate and painstaking, and Marcia in
triumph nailed his coat-tails to the roof, according
to the time-honored privilege of the
shingle-nailer, if the shingle-layer lets himself
get caught up with.
</p>
<p>
It was from Marcia and her brother that
I first heard the expression “var,” for balsam
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152'></a>152</span>
fir. This is our general country term; but
I do not know whether this is a survival of
some older form, or a corruption. Here in the
Watson Hill neighborhood I have also heard
the old-fashioned word “suent,” meaning convenient,
suitable, so familiar in dialect stories
of Somersetshire and Devon.
</p>
<p>
It was well past the fall of the year before
we drove Marcia home again, and a wild
autumn storm of wind and heavy rain had
carried away all but the last of the hanging
leaves. The shores of the ponds and rivers
showed clear ashes-and-slate colors, and clear
dark grays, but the fields were the pale russet
which lasts all winter under the snow. Beech
leaves were still hanging, a beautiful tender
fawn color, and, of course, oak leaves, and the
gray birches were like puffs of pale yellow
smoke in among the purple and ashen woods.
Crab-apples still hung, withered red, on the
trees, and the hips of the wild roses and haws
of the hawthorns, and the black alder berries,
made little blurs of scarlet in the swamps.
Here and there the road dipped through small
copses, bare of leaves, where there were
masses of clematis, carrying its tufts of soft
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153'></a>153</span>
gray fluff, entwined among the bushes, and
milkweed pods, just letting out their shining
silver-white silk. Witch-hazel was in flower
all through the woods.
</p>
<p>
The evergreens showed up everywhere, in
delicate vigorous beauty, and we counted unguessed
masses of pine among the hills. I
think we always expect a little sadness with
the fall of the leaves, but instead there is a
sense of elation, with the greater spread of
light and the wider views opening everywhere.
The wood roads showed more plainly
than in summer, and paths stood out green
across the fields. The tender unveiling of
autumn had revealed the hidden topography
of the forest, and countless small ravines and
slopes were suddenly made plain. There were
smaller, friendly revelations, too, for we came
here and there, on large and small nests, and
saw where the vireos and warblers had had
their tiny housekeeping.
</p>
<p>
Late ploughing was over, and hauling had
begun. We passed a good many loads of
potatoes and apples, on their way to the railroad,
and then a load of wood, and one of
balsam fir boughs, for banking the houses.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154'></a>154</span>
The wood was drawn by a pair of handsome
black and cream-white oxen, and the
boughs by a pair of “old natives,” plain red
brown. The potatoes and fruit must all be
hauled before the cold is too great.
</p>
<p>
For the last three miles before the land
opens out into the Watson farms, the hills
are covered with low woods, above which rises
the pointed head of Rattlesnake Hill, the
only high land in sight. The woods were
like purplish fur over the hillsides, and nearer
showed countless perfect rounded gray rods
and wands, like fine strokes of a brush. There
was a great shining of wet rocks and mossy
places. It was one of those still late-autumn
mornings, perfectly clear after the rain, when
the air is as fragrant and full of life as in
spring.
</p>
<p>
Longfellow Pond lies in a hollow of the
woods, three miles from anywhere, a beautiful
little wild wooded place, three-quarters
of a mile long, where wild duck come. Alas!
when we came near, a portable saw-mill was
at work close to the shore! A high pile of
warm-colored sawdust rose already in the
beautiful green of the pine wood. They had
just felled three big pines, and the new-cut
butts showed white among the masses of
lopped branches.

<span class='caption'>LONGFELLOW POND LIES IN THE HOLLOW OF THE WOODS</span>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155'></a>155</span></div>
<p>
The stretch of wooded country about the
pond lies in a belt or fold between two prosperous
farming districts, and has its own
population, a gipsy-looking set, living in the
woods in little shacks, half-farmhouse, half-shanty,
with a few straggling chickens. The
men of this place were working for the
operator of the saw-mill. It was dinner-time
when we came by, and half a dozen lithe dark
young men were sitting about on the log ends,
eating their dinner, which some little dusky
children had brought them in pails and odd
dishes.
</p>
<p>
We walked down between the stacks of
fragrant new-cut lumber to the edge of the
pond, which lay between its wooded shores,
as blue as the sky, sparkling in the sunshine.
We could make out three duck at the farther
end of it. It is a pity to have the fine growth
of pine cut, but it grows fast again with us.
Nobody cares for the lesser hard wood
growths in such an over-forested State as
ours, and once the saw-mill is gone, the pond
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156'></a>156</span>
will probably stay its wild lonely self, perhaps
for ages.
</p>
<p>
The last day that Marcia was with us she
wanted to see the river, and we went down
and found the flood tide making strongly,
two or three gulls sailing peacefully about,
and a late coal barge being towed down
against the tide. We had three days of still
deep frost after this, and the next day when
I went down to a hill overlooking one of the
most beautiful reaches of the river, there it
lay, a transparent gray mirror, not to move
again until April. All the colors of the banks
were pearl and ashen. Though it lay so still,
it whispered and talked to itself incessantly.
There were little ringing gurgles, like the
sound of a glass water-hammer; now tinklings,
now the fall of a tiny crystal avalanche; with
occasional deeper soft boomings and resoundings,
and all the time a whispered swish-swish
along the banks, the sound of the soft breaking
and fall of the shell ice as the tide ebbed.

<h1>CHAPTER XIV—EARLY WINTER.</h1>
<p>
&#160;<br />
</p>
<p>
Like the inside of a pearl; like the inside
of a star-sapphire; like a rainbow at twilight.
We are in a white world, and save for the rich
warmth of the pines and hemlocks there is
no color stronger than the delicate penciling
of the woods; but the whiteness is softened
all day by a frost-haze which the sunlight
turns into silver. The horizon is veiled with
smoke-color and tender opal. It is as if the
world retired for a little to a space of softened
sunrise colors, never hard or sharp; lovely and
unearthly as the clouds. We are so well to
the north that in winter we enter the sub-arctic
borderland, the shadowy-twilight regions
of the two ends of the earth.
</p>
<p>
It is a very still time of year, there is a
wonderful uplifting quiet. The sun burns low
in the south, a mass of soft white fire, not
blinding as in summer; its light plainly that
of a great low-hanging star.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158'></a>158</span>
</p>
<p>
This is the dark season; but to make up
for the shortness of the days we are given
such glories of sunrise and sunset, and such
a glittering brilliancy of stars, as come at no
other time. All summer these belong to
farmers, shepherds, and sailors; but now even
slug-abeds can be out before first light, and
watch the great stars fade, and dawn grow,
and then come back to that cozy and exciting
feast, breakfast by candle and fire light.
</p>
<p>
You step out into the frosty dark, with
Venus pulsing and burning like a great lamp,
and the snow luminous around you. The
stars are like diamonds, and the sky black,
and lo! there is the Dipper, straight overhead.
It is night, yet not night, because of the
whiteness of the snow, and because the air is
already alive with the coming morning. The
snow crunches sharply underfoot. The dry
air tickles and tingles and makes you cough.
The street lamps are still bright, and here and
there the lighted windows of other early
risers show a cheerful yellow in the snow.
It is a friendly time of day. Neighbors call
good-morning to each other in the dark, and
sleigh-bells jingle past. Then you come home
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159'></a>159</span>
to the firelight and the gay-lighted breakfast
table, with dawn stealing up fast, like lamplight
spreading from the bright crack under a
door.
</p>
<p>
As the first shafts of sunlight strike across,
they light up a million frost-crystals. The
air is alive with them, on all sides, delicate
star and wheel shapes, flashing like diamonds.
This beautiful phenomenon lasts only about
half an hour. The fairy crystals, light as the
air, floating about you, vanish, but the snow
continues to flash softly, from countless tiny
stars and facets, all day.
</p>
<p>
Frost mists hover all day about our valley,
the breath of the sleeping river. They are
drawn through our streets all day in veils and
wisps of softness. Smoke and steam clouds hold
their shape long in the winter temperatures.
At night the smoke from the chimneys curls
up in pale blue columns in the rarefied air,
against the dark but clear blue of the winter
night sky. By day the steam puffs from the
locomotives rise pinky-buff, or almost gold-color,
and keep their shape for a few moments
as firm as thunderheads.
</p>
<p>
This year, mid-winter for the sun is the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160'></a>160</span>
moon’s midsummer. The full moon rises and
sets so far to the north that she completes full
three-quarters of the circle. At night she rides
at the zenith, high and small, and the snow
fields seem illimitable and remote under her
lonely light. The expanse of snow so increases
both sun and moon light that she seems to rise
while it is still broad day; and still to be shining
with full silver, in her unwonted northern
station, after broad day again, at dawn.
</p>
<p>
We share some of the phenomena of
light of the polar regions. Moon rainbows
are sometimes seen at night; and as this is
the season of most frequent mock suns—<em>par-helia</em>—so
also mock moons—<em>par-selenes</em>—half-nebulous,
massed effects of softly bright
radiance, appear on the hovering frost mists;
and sharply outlined lunar halos herald snowstorms.
</p>
<p>
Indeed the greatly increased extent of snow-expanse
magnifies all effects of light extraordinarily.
</p>
<p>
At sunset, softened colors, “peach-blossom
and dove-color,” like the bands of a wide and
diffused rainbow, appear in the <em>east</em>; this is
the sunset light, caught by the snowfields, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161'></a>161</span>
reflected on the eastern clouds and mists. Not
only this; the “old moon in the new moon’s
arms,” instead of being a blank mass, as in
summer, is darkly luminous, so greatly has the
earth-shine on the moon been magnified.
</p>
<p>
A winter night is never really dark. Thanks
to the rarefied air, the stars burn and blaze as
at no other season; Sirius appearing to sparkle
with an even bluer light than in summer. You
can tell time by a small watch, easily, by starlight,
with no other aid but the diffused glimmer
of the snow fields.
</p>
<p>
The other morning an errand took my
brother and me out early over the long hill
that makes the Height of Land to the west.
There must have been an amazing fall of
frost-dew the night before, for we saw a
sight which I shall never forget; not only
the twigs and the branches, but the actual
trunks of the trees, the stone-walls, and the
roadside shrubberies and seed-vessels, frosted
with crystals like fern-fronds, two inches or
more long. There is a wood of pines at
the crest of the hill, and here not a green
needle showed, not one bit of bark; the trees
rose pure white against the pure blue
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162'></a>162</span>
sky, over the white skyline of the hill. Looking
out over the country, all the woods were
silver; silver-white where the light took them,
silver-gray in shadow. Light flashed round
us everywhere, so that it was almost dazzling,
yet it was softened light; stars, not diamonds.
</p>
<p>
Once the snow comes, the neighborhood
settles to a certain happy quiet. It is as if
winter laid a strong arm about us, encircling
and soothing. The dry air sparkles like
wine. Dusk falls early; the wood fires on the
hearths burn bright, and the evenings beside
them are never too long. It is a neighborly
time, and the long peaceful hours of work
bring a sense of achievement.
</p>
<p>
Out on the farms, the year’s supply of
wood is being cut. This, with hauling the
hay, and ice-cutting, makes the chief winter
work; and the men who are out chopping all
day in the woods become hardy indeed.
</p>
<div class='figcenter' style='padding-top: 1em; padding-bottom: 1em'>

<img src='images/illus192.jpg' alt='ICE-CUTTING ON THE RIVER BEGINS IN JANUARY' width='95%' title=''/><br />
<span class='caption'>ICE-CUTTING ON THE RIVER BEGINS IN JANUARY</span>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163'></a>163</span></div>
<p>
Ice-cutting on the river begins in January.
The wide hollow of the river valley is so
white that the men and horses moving up
and down stand out in warm color; the
strange snow silence makes an almost palpable
background to the cheerful and sharp
sounds of work, the ring of metal, the squeak
of leather, the men’s shouts and talk, and the
steady roar which goes up from the ice ploughs
and cutters. There are small portable forges
here and there for mending tools, at the fires
of which the men heat their coffee. The ice-cakes
are clear blue, and they are lifted out
and started up the run in leisurely procession.
Directly the first cutting is made you have the
startling sight of a field of bright blue living
water in the midst of the whiteness; while
along the shore, the rising tide often overflows
the shore ice, in pools and rivulets, the color
of yellow-green jade.
</p>
<p>
The work is done with heavy steel tools.
First the ice must be marked, then planed to a
smooth surface, then grooved more deeply,
and for the last few inches sawed by hand
with long ice-saws. It is pleasant work on
sunny days, and the men, who have mostly
come in from the farms, like its sociableness;
but often the wind sweeps down the valley
bitterly cold, and then it is very severe, especially
the work of keeping the canals open at
night. The ice generally runs to about two
feet thick.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164'></a>164</span>
</p>
<p>
The ice-business in our valley has fallen
off since the formation of the Ice Trust and
the increased use of artificial ice. A great
part of our ice fields are only held in reserve
now, in case the more southern ice fails, but it
still makes a winter harvest for us. The
river towns must always have their own ice,
and the farmers who cut it get good pay for
their work and that of their horses. They
speak of the work entirely in farm terms.
They “cultivate” the ice, and “harvest” the
“crop.”
</p>
<p>
Last week we made an expedition across
country to where the beautiful little chain
of the Assimasqua ponds and streams lies
between the ranges of Maple Hill on the west,
and Wrenn’s Mountain on the east; and there,
on Upper Assimasqua, was the same phenomenon
of frost-crystals which we saw on
Dunnack Hill, only here it was on the ice.
We thought at first the pond was covered with
snow, but as we walked out on it, we saw
it was frost, in such ice-flowers as I have
never seen before. They were like clusters of
crystal fern-fronds, each frond an inch and a
half to two inches long. At first these flowers
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165'></a>165</span>
were scattered in clusters about six inches
apart over the black ice, but farther on they
ran together into a solid field of silver, a
miniature forest of flashing fern or palm
fronds, so delicate and light it seemed as if
they must bend with the breeze. They outlined
each crack in the ice with close garlands.
We could hardly bear to crush them as we
walked through them.
</p>
<p>
The four Assimasqua Ponds lie low between
hills that are heavily wooded, mostly with
beech and hemlock. The shores are high and
irregular and jut out in narrow points, and
these and the islands have small cliffs, of
gnarled and twisted strata, which the hemlocks
overhang, in masses of feathery green.
</p>
<p>
There was something appealing and endearing
in the beauty of this little forest chain
of lakes and streams, lying still and white
between its wooded shores. We crossed its
wide surface on foot, and followed up the
course of the stream which whirled and tumbled
so, only a month ago. Every tiny reach
and channel was ours to explore. It was as
quiet as a child lying asleep.
</p>
<p>
We built a fire on the south shore of a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166'></a>166</span>
headland, where a curve of the gnarled cliffs
enclosed a tiny beach, cooked bacon, and
heated coffee. Twenty yards from the shore
there was a round hole, some eight inches
across, of black dimpling water. It had
not been cut, but was natural, being, I
suppose, over a warm spring. The ice
was so strong around it that we could drink
from it.
</p>
<p>
It was so warm in the sun that we sat
about bareheaded and barehanded, yet not a
frost-needle melted. The sunlight glinted on
the hemlock needles, all the way up the hillsides,
and a balsamy sweetness seemed to be
all about us, mixed with the pungent smoke
of our wood fire.
</p>
<p>
The chickadees were busy all round us,
making little bright chirrupy sounds. We
could hear blue-jays calling, deeper in the
woods, and the occasional “crake, crake,
crake,” of a blue nuthatch. The dry winter
woods cracked and the pond rang and gurgled
with pretty hollow noises. The hemlocks
had fruited heavily, and were hung all
over with little bright brown cones, like
Christmas trees. They seem to give out
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167'></a>167</span>
fragrant sunny health all winter, a dry thrifty
vigor.
</p>
<p>
We did not see a soul on all the Upper
Ponds, and only fox tracks ran in and out of
the marsh-grasses of the stream, but on
Lower Assimasqua there were men cutting
wood. They were cutting out beech and
white and yellow birch for firewood, and
leaving the hemlock, which grew very thick
here. The cut wood stood about the slope in
neatly piled bright-colored stacks, with colored
chips among the fallen branches, and the
axe blows rang sharp and musical in the winter
silence. The men, who were good-looking
fellows, wore woolen or corduroy, with high
moccasins, and their sheepskin and mackinaw
coats were thrown aside on the snow. There
were five or six of them, mostly young men,
and one handsome older man, with hawk
features and a bright color, silver hair and
beard, and bright warm brown eyes. They
had bread, doughnuts, and pie for their dinner,
and a jug of cider.
</p>
<p>
The Lower is the largest of the four ponds.
It is, perhaps, three miles long by a mile wide,
but it seemed almost limitless, under the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168'></a>168</span>
snow, and we felt like pygmy creatures, walking
in the midst, with the unbroken level
stretching away around us.
</p>
<p>
The sky was deepening into indescribable
colors, peacock blue, peacock gray, and in
the middle of the expanse, over the woods,
we saw the great full moon, just rising clear
out of the violet and opal tenebrae, the
fringes of the sky. She was as pale as a
bubble, or as the palest pink summer cloud,
but gathered color fast, then poured her floods
of silver. The whiteness of the pond glimmered
more and more strangely as dusk increased.
</p>
<p>
We came home, stiff and happy, to a great
wood fire, piled in a wide and deep fireplace,
and to a room of firelight and evergreen-scented
shadows.
</p>
<p>
That night a light rain fell, then turned
to a busy snow-storm, which fell for hours
on the wet surfaces in thick soft-falling
flakes, so that by the next morning the
world was a fairy forest of white. The
trees bent down under their feathery load.
Wonderful low intricately crossed branches
were everywhere. Each littlest grove and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169'></a>169</span>
clump of shrubbery became a dense thicket
of white. This fairy forest was close, close
round us, so that each street seemed magical
and unfamiliar, a place that we had never
seen before. It was a perfectly hushed world.
Our footsteps made no sound, and even the
masses from the overladen branches came
down silently. Everything but whiteness was
obliterated; then at night the moon came
out clear again, and lighted up this fairy
world, and the white spirits of trees stood up
against the gray-black sky.
</p>
<p>
Ten days after this there followed a great
ice-storm, when for two days rain fell incessantly,
and, as it fell, covered the twigs
and branches with crystal. It cleared on the
third morning, and instead of white, we were
in a world of diamond. The dazzling brilliancy
was almost more than the eye could
bear. Every blade of grass and seed-vessel
was changed to a crystal jewel, and the
breeze set them tinkling. The sky was fairy
blue. The woods and all the fields flashed
round us as we walked almost spell-bound
through their strange beauty. The wonder
was that the whole star-like world did not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170'></a>170</span>
clash and ring as if with silver harp music.
</p>
<p>
As the sun rose higher, the country was
veiled with frost haze, but through it, and
beyond, we saw the shining of the crust on
all the distant hills.

<h1>CHAPTER XV—ASSIMASQUA, AND MARSTON</h1>
<p>
&#160;<br />
</p>
<p>
Assimasqua Mountain rises abruptly to the
west of the four ponds, a noble hill or range,
five miles in length.
</p>
<p>
The west shore of the Assimasqua lakes
sweeps abruptly up to the high crest of the
ridge, which is very irregular. It is partly
wooded, partly half-grown-up pasture, partly
ledge, and along the high grassy summit
small chasms open and lead away into deep
woods of hemlock. The steep east side is
covered for most of its length with an amazing
growth of juniper, hundreds and hundreds
of close-massed bushes of great size and
thickness. The ridge holds a number of little
dark mountain tarns, and half a dozen good
brooks tumble down its sides in small cascades.
The folds of its forest skirts broaden
out to the west into the bottom lands at its
feet. To the east, the valleys of the brooks
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172'></a>172</span>
deepen and sharpen into ravines through the
woods, as they draw near the lakes.
</p>
<p>
The shores all about the four lakes, as
I said, are heavily wooded, and there are but
one or two farms, and these only small clearings.
A singular person lived in one of them,
who worked for years over a great invention,
a boat which was to utilize the wind by
means of a windmill, which in turn worked a
small paddle-wheel. No one now knows
whether he had never heard of such a thing
as a sail, or merely thought sails dangerous.
He was absorbed in his project; and he did
get his boat to go, in time, and at least a
few times she trundled a clumsy course
around the lake.
</p>
<p>
Near the south end of the Mountain is
the old Hale place. Mr. Hale was a gentle-looking
man, very neat, with a quiet voice
and ways. He kept his wide fields finely
cultivated, and had a large orchard, and
twelve Jersey cows. The lane through which
they filed home at night is enclosed between
the two mightiest stump fences I have ever
seen, fully ten feet high, and a perfect wilderness
to climb over. They look like the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173'></a>173</span>
brandished arms of witches, or like enormous
antlers, against the sky, and are thickly
fringed all along their base with delicate
Dicksonia fern. Stump fences are fast becoming
rare with us, and these must be the over-turned
stumps of first-growth pine.
</p>
<p>
After Mr. and Mrs. Hale died, the farm
passed to a sister, Mrs. Wrenn, and when her
husband, too, died—he had been a slack
man, with no hold on anything—she made
the fatal mistake, too common among old
people on the farms, of making over the
property to a kinsman (in this case, a married
step-niece and her husband) on condition of
support. I never knew Mrs. Wrenn, but a
young farmer’s wife, a friend of mine, was
anxious about her troubles, and through her
there came to our notice an incident which
seemed to light up the whole gray region
of the farm.
</p>
<p>
The neighbors began to hear rumors of
neglect and abuse. Mrs. Wrenn was never
seen, and those who knew the skinflint ways
of her entertainers suspected trouble and
presently confided their fears to the young
doctor of the neighborhood. He came at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174'></a>174</span>
once, and found the poor soul in a fatal illness,
left alone in unspeakable dirt and
squalor in a sort of out-house, with unwashed
bed-clothes, no one to feed or tend her, and
food which she could not touch put roughly
beside her once a day. There were signs too
of actual rough handling.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t try to make me live!” the old lady
whispered, with command and entreaty.
“Don’t ye dare to keep me living,” and he
assured her solemnly that he would not, except
in reason, and would only make her
more comfortable. He rated the bad woman
in charge till he had her well frightened, and
then, though it was not only dark already,
but raining fast (and though he was
poor himself, with his way to make and no
financial backing) he drove five miles to town
and brought back and installed a nurse at his
own expense.
</p>
<p>
“The tears were running down his cheeks,”
the nurse herself told me, “when he assured
that poor old creature that either he or I
would be with her day and night, that we
would never leave her, and she would be
safe with us. He paid my charges, and all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175'></a>175</span>
supplies and food, out of his own pocket.
He saw her every day, and when her release
came, he was close beside her, and had her
hand in his. He couldn’t have been more
tender to his own mother. And he gave
that bad woman a part of what she deserved.”
</p>
<p>
I should like to say something more of this
young physician. He started as a farm boy,
with no capital beyond insight and purpose,
and skilled hands, and was led to his career,
or rather could not keep himself from his
career, because of the fire of pity and tenderness
that possessed him. He has come to
honor and recognition now, but at the time
of which I write, and for years, he was known
only to a thirty-mile circle of farm people,
a good part of them too poor to pay for any
services. He gave himself to them, without
knowing that he was giving anything. He
was a born citizen, too, served as overseer of
the poor, and as selectman, and people consulted
him about their quarrels and troubles.
</p>
<p>
I spoke of the incident about Mrs. Wrenn,
which the nurse had told me a year or more
after it happened, to the doctor’s wife, some
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176'></a>176</span>
weeks since. He had never told her of it. Her
eyes filled with tears.
</p>
<p>
“That is just like him,” she said.
</p>
<p>
The Ridge slopes down to the west, to the
rich plains through which the Marston communities
are scattered—Marston Centre,
North and West Marston, Marston Plains.
The “Four Marstons” are a notable district,
for Marston Academy had the luck to be
founded, nearly a hundred years ago, by persons
of liberal education, and the dwellers in
the comfortable four-square brick houses of
the neighborhood have more than kept up its
intellectual traditions; though the town has
no railroad communication, and only one mill,
the shovel factory, since the old saw-mill
which cut the first-growth pines on the slopes
of Assimasqua has been given up.
</p>
<p>
The Marston saw-mill is chiefly remembered
because of Hiram Andros, who worked
there as sawyer for forty-five years, and had
the name of the best judge of timber in the
State. The <em>sawyer’s</em> is a notable position. He
himself does no actual work, but stands near
the saw, and in the brief moment when each
log is run on to the carriage, holds up the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177'></a>177</span>
requisite number of fingers to show whether
it is to be a three, a four, or five-inch timber,
or cut into boards or planks; which cut will
make the best use of the log, with the least
waste. The sawyer gets high pay, six to ten
dollars a day, and earns it, for on his single
judgment, delivered in that fraction of a
minute, the mill’s prosperity hangs.
</p>
<p>
What is it that gives a town so distinct a
color and fibre? Marston people have kept,
generation after generation, a fine flavor and
distinction. They are in touch with the
world, in the best sense, and men of science
and leaders of thought in university life, as
well as business magnates, have gone out
from Marston, yet still feel they belong there.
</p>
<p>
Eliphalet Marston, who built and owned
the shovel factory, made it his study to produce
the best shovel that could be made, the
best wearing, the soundest. In later life his
son tried to induce him to go about through
the country, and look up his customers, to
increase trade. The son was very emphatic;
it was what everyone did, the only way to
keep up-to-date and advertise the business,
and Eliphalet must not become moss-grown.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178'></a>178</span>
He shook his head, but after much hammering
started off, though not really persuaded.
He went to a big wholesale dealer in Chicago,
but did not mention his name, merely said he
was there to talk shovels.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t mention shovels to me,” said the
dealer. “There’s just one shovel that’s worth
having, just one that’s honest, and that’s the
one that I’m handling. There it is,” he said,
producing it. “Look at it; that’s the only
<em>shovel</em> that’s made in this country; made by
a man named Marston, at Marston Plains,
State of ——”
</p>
<p>
Eliphalet chuckled, and went home.
</p>
<p>
The Barnards were Marston people, a brilliant
but strange family; and next door to the
Barnards lived a remarkable woman, Miss
Persis Wayland. She was a tall handsome
person, of a large frame. She lived to a
great age, passing all her later life alone, save
for one attendant, in her father’s large
house, with its gardens and hedges around
it. She was well-to-do, and dressed with old-fashioned
stateliness in heavy black silk.
</p>
<p>
She was a woman of fine understanding,
and a trained scholar. She read four
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179'></a>179</span>
languages easily, and at forty took up the study
of Hebrew, that she might have her Bible
free from the perversions of translation. She
was about thirty when the religious temperament
which was later to dominate her first
manifested itself. She has told me herself
of her experience.
</p>
<p>
She had been conscious for years of a
vague dissatisfaction, and of life’s seeming
empty and purposeless. She threw herself,
first into study, then into works of charity,
in her effort to find peace. She rose early, and
worked till she was utterly worn out and exhausted,
at her Sunday School class, at missionary
work, and till late hours at her Spanish
and Latin, all to no purpose.
</p>
<p>
Then one day she found herself at a meeting
at which a Methodist evangelist (she herself
was a strict Episcopalian) was to speak.
She went in without thought, from a chance
impulse as she passed the door. After the
speaking, those who felt moved to do so were
asked to come forward and kneel; and as she
knelt, she felt the breath of the Spirit upon her
forehead.
</p>
<p>
“It was as plain as the touch of your hand
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180'></a>180</span>
and mine,” she said, as she laid her handsome
old hand on my fingers; and from that moment,
all her life, the light never left her, she
felt “held round by an unspeakable peace and
sunshine.”
</p>
<p>
She always held to her own church, but
became more and more of a Spiritualist, till
she saw her rooms constantly thronged with
the faces of her childhood, father and mother,
and the brothers and sisters and playmates
who had passed on.
</p>
<p>
She gradually withdrew from active life,
and for the last ten years, I think, never
stepped outside her door. She had a fine
presence always, rapt and stately. She was
distantly glad to see friends who called upon
her, but never showed much human warmth.
She lived till her ninety-eighth year.

<p>
In the farming country near Marston began
the ministry of Clarissa Gray, the beloved
evangelist. An unusual experience in illness
led this grave, charming girl to thought apart
upon the things of God, and as she grew up,
persons vexed in spirit began to turn to her
for comfort. Her personality was so tranquil
and at rest that she seemed to diffuse a sense
of musing peace about her; yet she was not
dreamy; her nature was rather so limpidly
clear that she was never pre-occupied, and
she had clear practical good-sense. Hard-drinking,
violent men would yield to her
direct and fearless influence. Presently she
was asked more and more widely to lead in
meeting, and to her unquestioning nature this
came as a clear call. Her voice, fervent and
pure, led in prayer, her crystal judgement
solved problems, till without her ever knowing
it the community lay in the hollow of
her small hands.
</p>
<p>
I was last at Marston on a day of deep
winter. We were to make a visit in the town,
and then explore the fields and woods of the
west slopes of Assimasqua.
</p>
<p>
A marked change comes to us by the middle
of January. We emerge from the softened
twilight world of earlier winter into a brilliancy
of white, with bright blue shadows.
The deep snow is changed by the action of
the wind and its own weight, to a wonderful
smooth firmness. It takes on carved and
graven shapes, and might be a sublimated
building material, a fairy alabaster or marble,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182'></a>182</span>
fit to built the palaces in the clouds. After
each storm the snow-plough piles it, often
above one’s head, on both sides of the roads
and sidewalks; we walk between high walls
built of blocks and masses of blue-shadowed
white.
</p>
<p>
The brightness is almost too great, through
the middle of the day; it is dazzling; but
about sunset a curious opaque look falls on the
landscape; a flattening, till they are like the
hues of old pastels, of all the delicate colors.
The country has an appearance of almost infinite
space, under the snow, and the wind
carves out pure sharp wave-like curves of drift
about the fields and hills.
</p>
<p>
The still air, dry and fiery, is like champagne.
It almost <em>burns</em>, it is so cold and pure.
A great feeling of lightness comes to moccasined
feet, in walking in this rarefied air
through powdery snow; but fingers and toes
quickly become numb without even feeling
the cold.
</p>
<p>
Starting early out of Marston Plains village,
we passed a tall rounded hill which had
a grove of maples near its top, the countless
fine lines of their stems like the strings of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183'></a>183</span>
some harp-like instrument. The light breeze,
hardly more than a stirring, made music
through them. The sunrise was hidden behind
this hill, but the delicate bare trees were
lighted up as with a gold mist.
</p>
<p>
As we entered the forest on the skirts of
Assimasqua, the wind rose outside. A fresh
fall of snow the day before had weighted every
branch of the evergreens with piled-up whiteness,
which now came down in bright
showers, the snow crystals glinting around
us where stray sunbeams stole down among
the trees: but in the shelter of the great
pines and hemlocks not a breath of wind
reached us, and the woods were held fast in
the snow hush, against which any chance
sound rings out sharply.
</p>
<p>
The bark of the different trees was like a
set of fine etchings, the yellow birches
shining as if burnished; the patches of
handsome dark mosses on the ash-trees, and
the fine-grained bark of lindens, ashes, and
hop-hornbeams stood out brightly.
</p>
<p>
As we followed a wood road we heard chirruping
and tweeting, and saw a flock of pine
siskins among the pine-tops, and later we
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184'></a>184</span>
heard the vigorous tapping of a great pileated
woodpecker.
</p>
<p>
All the northern woodpeckers winter with
us; as do bluejays, and chickadees, (the
“friendly birds” of the Indians); juncos and
nuthatches; and partridges, which burrow
under the snow for roots and berries, and are
sometimes caught, poor things, by the foxes,
when the crust freezes over them. Crows
stay with us through a very mild winter, but
more often are off to the sea, thirty miles distant,
to grow fat on periwinkles; and very
rarely indeed a winter wren or a song-sparrow
remains with us. The beautiful
cream-white snow-buntings, cross-bills, fat
handsome pine-grosbeaks, golden-crowned
kinglets, brown-creepers, and those pirates,
the butcher birds, come for short winter visits.
Evening grosbeaks, and Bohemian wax-wings,
we see more rarely. By the end of February,
when the cold may be deepest, the great owls
are already building, deep in the woods.
</p>
<p>
Ever so many small sharp valleys and ravines
were revealed among the woods, some winding
deep into the darkness of the pines and
hemlocks. Their perfect curves were made
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185'></a>185</span>
more perfect by the unbroken snow, and they
were flecked all over with the feathery blue
shadows of their trees. At the bottom of one
we heard a musical tinkling, and found a
brook partly open. We scrambled down to
it, and knelt there, watching it, till we were
half frozen. The ice was frosted deep with
delicate lace-work, and looking up underneath
we saw a perfect wonderland of organ-pipes
and colonnades of crystal, through which the
water tinkled melodiously.
</p>
<p>
We came out high on the north side of
Assimasqua, in the sugaring grove that
spreads up the steep slope to the crest. The
tall maples were very beautiful in their winter
bareness, and the slope about their feet
was massed with a close feathery growth of
young balsam firs and hemlocks, with openings
between. The snow lay even with the
eaves of the small bark sugaring-shanty. The
sight of a roof made the silence seem almost
palpable, but in March the hillside will have
plenty of sound and stir, for fires will be
lighted and the big kettles swung, while the
men come and go on sledges. Sugaring goes
on all through the countryside, and even in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186'></a>186</span>
the town boys are out with “spiles,” drilling
the maple “shade-trees,” as soon as the sap
begins running. The bright drops fall slowly,
one by one, into the pail hung to the end of
the spile, and the sap is like the clearest
spring water, with a refreshing woodsy
sweetness.
</p>
<p>
The high rough crest of Assimasqua dominates
a wide stretch of country. The long
sweep of the fields, and the lakes, lying asleep,
showed perfect, featureless white, as we stood
looking down; but all about, and in among
them, the low broken hills, the knolls and
ridges, bore scarfs or mantles of smoke-colored
bare woods, mixed with evergreens.
</p>
<p>
All day the sky had been of an aquamarine
color, of the liquid and luminous clearness
which comes only in mid-winter, and deep
afternoon shadows were falling as we came
down the hillside. We were on snow-shoes,
and had brought a toboggan, as the last part
of our way lay down hill. The country
was open below the sugaring grove, and
the unbroken snow masked all the contours
and mouldings of the fields, so that we
found ourselves suddenly dropping into
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187'></a>187</span>
totally unrealized hollows and skimming up
unrealized hillocks.
</p>
<p>
When we reached the small dome-like hill
where we were to take the cross-country trolley,
the blue-green sky had changed to a
pure primrose, and in this, as the marvelous
dusk of the snow fields deepened
about us, the thin golden sickle of the new
moon, and then Venus, came out slowly till
they blazed above the horizon; the primrose
hue changed to a low band of burning orange
beneath the fast-striding darkness, then to a
blue-green color, a robin’s egg blue, which
showed liquid-clear behind the pines; but long
before we reached home the colors had deepened
into the peacock blue darkness of the
winter night.
</p>
<p>
Just before the distant whistle of the trolley
broke the stillness, we had a tiny adventure;
we strayed over the brow of the hill,
and came on two baby foxes playing in the
soft snow like kittens.

<h1>CHAPTER XVI—OUR TOWN</h1>
<p>
&#160;<br />
</p>
<p>
I
</p>
<p>
The farms become smaller, and string along
nearer and nearer each other, the hills slope
more and more sharply, till suddenly, there
below them lies our Town, held round in
their embrace, its factory chimneys sending
up blossoms of steam, its host of scattered
lights at night a company of low-dropped
stars. There is no visible boundary; but with
the first electric light pole there is a change,
and something deeper-rooted than its convenience
and compactness, its theatres and trolleys,
makes the town’s life as different as possible
from that of the farm districts. Yet an
affectionate relationship maintains itself between
the two. Farm neighbors bring in a
little area of unhurried friendliness which
clings around their Concord wagons or pungs;
hurrying townsfolk, stopping to greet them,
relax their tension and an exchange of jokes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189'></a>189</span>
and chaff begins. Leisurely, ample farm
women settle down in our Rest Room for
friendly talk and laughter, and hot coffee or
tea.
</p>
<p>
Our dearest Town! We have perhaps some
of the faults of all northern places. We, at
least we women, are sad <em>Marthas</em>, careful and
troubled, including house-cleaning with seed-time
and harvest among the things ordained
not to fail, no matter at what cost of peace of
mind and health. We hug each our own fireside;
but this is because, for eight months of
the year, the great cold gives us a habit of
tension. We enjoy too little the elixir of
our still winter days, and hurry, hurry as we
go, to pop back to our warm hearths as fast
as ever we can.
</p>
<p>
Now and again through the year, the big
cities call us with a Siren’s voice.
</p>
<p>
“My wife and I put in ten days at the Waldorf-Astoria
each year, and we count it good
business,” says one of our tradesmen, and he
speaks for many. The clustered brilliancy at
the entrances of the great theatres, the shop
windows, the sense of being <em>carried</em> by the
great current of life, sets our feet and our
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190'></a>190</span>
pulses dancing; but I think it is not quite so
much the stir and gaiety which we sometimes
thirst for as the protecting insulation of the
crowd, to draw breath in a little and let the
mind relax. The wall that guards one’s citadel
of inner privacy needs, in a small town, to be
built of strong stuff; it is subjected to hard
wear. Indeed we share some of the privations
of royalty, in that we lead our whole lives in
the public eye. We see each other walk past
every day, greet each other daily in shops and
at street corners, and meet each other’s good
frocks and company manners at every church
supper and afternoon tea. It takes a nature
with Heaven’s gift of unconsciousness to withstand
this wear and tear; yet there are plenty
of these among us, people of such quality and
fibre that they keep a fine aloofness and privacy
of life, like sanctuary gardens within
guardian hedges.
</p>
<p>
But if our closeness to each other has
these slight drawbacks, it has advantages that
are unspeakably precious. Our neighbors’
joys and troubles are of instant importance
to us, each and all. In the city one can look
on while one’s neighbor dies or goes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191'></a>191</span>
bankrupt. Too often, one cannot help even where
one would; here we <em>must</em> help, whether we
will or no! We cannot get away from duties
that are so imperative. Our neighbor’s necessities
are unescapable, and a certain soldierly
quality comes to us in that we cannot <em>choose</em>.
</p>
<p>
An instinct, whether Puritan or Quaker,
runs straight through us, which at social
gatherings draws men and women to the two
sides of a room, as a magnet draws needles.
Perhaps it is merely the shyness inherent in
towns of small compass; in all the annals of
small places, in Cranford, in John Galt’s
villages, the ladies bridle and simper, the
gentlemen “begin for to bash and to blush,”
in each other’s society. Whatever it is, it
narrows and pinches communities, and does
sometimes more far-reaching harm than the
mere stiffening-up of parties and gatherings;
it narrows the women’s habit of thought, so
that children are deprived of some of the wider
outlook of citizenship; and the woman’s ministry
of cheering and soothing, which pours itself
out without stint to all <em>women</em> in old age or
sorrow or sickness, is too often withheld from
the men, who may be as lonely and troubled,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192'></a>192</span>
and may be left forlorn and uncheered. However,
this foolish thing vanishes before rich
and warm natures, like snow in a March sun.
</p>
<p>
I sometimes wish that our latch-strings
hung a little more on the outside. It is
easier for us to give a party, with great
effort, and our ancestral china, than to have
a friend drop in to share family supper; yet
there is something that makes for strength in
this fine privacy of each family’s circle, and
no doubt, as our social occasions are necessarily
few, a certain formality is the more a
real need. It “keeps up.”
</p>
<p>
One grave trouble runs through our community,
and leaves a black trail. Drink
poisons the lives of too many of our working-men.
</p>
<p>
The drain to the cities, which robs all small
places of part of their life’s blood, touches us
nearly; the young wings must be tried, the
young feet take the road. The restless sand
is in the shoes, and one out of perhaps every
twenty pairs sold in our street is to take a boy
or girl out to make a new home, far from father
and mother.
</p>
<p>
But this, although it robs us, is also our pride
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193'></a>193</span>
and strength. Many of the boys and girls who
have gone out from among us have become
torch-bearers, and their light shines back to
us; and if the town’s veins are drained, it is,
by the very means which drain it, made part
of the arterial system of the whole country,
and throbs with its heart beats. The enormous
variety of post-marks on our incoming mail
tells its absorbing story.
</p>
<p>
There is no sameness, even in a small town.
Here, as everywhere, the Creator lays here
and there His finger of difference; as if He
said, “Conformity is the law—and non-conformity.”
Why should one clear-eyed boy
among us have been born with the voice and
vision, and the sorrow-and-reward-full consecration,
of high poetry, rather than his
brothers? Why should another, of different
bringing-up, among a din of voices crying
down the town’s possibilities, have had the
wit and enterprise, yes, and the vision, too, to
build up, here, a vigorous manufactory, whose
wares, well planned and well made, now have
their market many States away?
</p>
<p>
I think of a third boy, the child of a well-read,
but not a studious household, who at ten
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194'></a>194</span>
was laying hands on everything that he could
find to study in the branch of science to which
his life was later to be dedicated. He had the
same surroundings as the rest of us, we went
to school and played at Indians together; and
now, for years, in a distant city, his life has led
him daily upon voyages of thought, beyond the
ken of those who played with him.
</p>
<p>
Another boy, our dear naturalist, also lives
far away. His able, merry brothers were the
most practical creatures; so was he, too, but
in another way. He turned, a little grave-eyed
child, to out-of-doors, as a duck takes to water,
caring for birds and beasts with a pure passion,
as absorbed in watching their ways as
were the other boys in games and food. It was
nothing to him to miss a meal, or two, if a
turtle’s eggs might be hatching. He had very
little to help him, for his father, a very fine
man, a master builder, failed in health early;
but he helped himself. He found countless little
out-of-the-way jobs; he mounted trout or
partridges for older friends, caught bait, exchanged
specimens through magazines, etc.,
to keep himself out of doors, and to buy books
and collecting materials. By the time he was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195'></a>195</span>
twelve he had a little taxidermy business; and
with the growth of technical skill, the finer
part, the naturalist’s seeing eye for infinite difference—the
shading of the moth’s wing, the
marking of the wren’s egg—grew faster yet;
and with it the patient reverent absorption in
the whole.
</p>
<p>
People come to him now for accurate and
delicate knowledge. His word gives the authority
which for so long he sought; and, at
least once, he has been sent by his Government
to bring back a report of birds and fishes,
and to plant his country’s flag on a lone coral
island.
</p>
<p>
The other night we went to a play given by
some of the school children. Their orchestra
played with spirit; and from the first we grew
absorbed in watching a little boy who played
the bass drum. The bass drum! He played
the snare-drum, the triangle, the cymbals, a
set of musical rattles, and I do not know how
many extraordinary things attached to hand
or feet, as well. Our northern music is choked
in the sand of over-business, prisoned by northern
stiffness, but shy, stiff, awkward though it
may be, the divine thing is there, as groundwater
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196'></a>196</span>
is present where there is land; and nothing
can keep our children from buying (generally
with their own earnings) instruments of
one sort or another, and picking up lessons.
</p>
<p>
I know this little boy. His father is a laborer,
a slack man, down at heels, but kind and
indulgent. The boy is a chubby little soul,
and he accompanied the showy rag-time as
Bach’s son might have played his father’s
masses, with a serious, reverent absorption,
his little unconscious face lighting up at any
prettier change in the rag-time. They live in
a tiny cottage, and are well-fed, but very untidy.
As the humming bird finds honey, this
child had somehow picked up odd pennies to
buy, and found time to master, his extraordinary
collection of instruments, and he sat playing
as if in Heaven. Surely we had seen yet another
manifestation of the Power, which, together
with the bright fields of golden-rod and
daisies, plants also the hidden lily in the woods.
</p>
<p>
II
</p>
<p>
Of the town’s politics, the less said the
better, but in every matter outside of their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197'></a>197</span>
withering realm, I wonder how many other
communities there are in which public spirit is
as much a matter of course as drawing breath,
where heart and soul are poured into the
town’s needs so royally. Our churches, our
Library, our Rest Room, Board of Trade,
and Merchants’ Association have been earned
by the hardest of hard work, shoulder to
shoulder. Most of our women do their own
household work, all of our men work long
hours; but when there is question of a public
work to be done, people will pledge, gravely
and with their eyes open, an amount of work
that would fairly stagger persons whose easier
lives have trained their fibres less hardily.
I wonder what would be the equivalent, in
dollars and cents, of the gift to one of the
town’s undertakings, by a stalwart house-wife
(who does all the work for a family of
five) of <em>every afternoon for three weeks</em>, and
this in December, when our Town loses its
head in a perfect riot of Christmas present-giving.
</p>
<p>
What is it in politics, what can it be, which
so poisons human initiative at its well-springs?
Here is public work which, we are told, we
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198'></a>198</span>
must accept (must we?) as a corrupting and
corrupt thing; it deadens and poisons; and almost
interlocking with it is work for the same
town’s good, done by the same people, which
invigorates as if with new breath and kindles
a living fire among us.
</p>
<p>
The peculiar problem of our town, the bitter,
fighting quality of our politics, is a mystery to
ourselves. One condition which presses
equally hard on the whole State: the constant
friction, and consequent moral undermining,
of a law constantly evaded: may be in part
responsible. But no doubt our intense, flint-and-steel
individualism is the chief factor; yet
this individualism is also the sap, the very
life-blood, of the tree!
</p>
<p>
(Surely things will be better when the ethics
of citizenship is taught to children as unequivocally
as the duty of telling the truth.)
</p>
<p>
With this citizen’s work, goes on a private
kindness so beautiful that one finds one’s self
without words, uplifted and humbled before
it; it is as if, below the obstructions of our
busy lives, there ran a river of friendship, so
strong, so single-purposed, that when the
rock above it is struck by need or adversity,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199'></a>199</span>
its pure current wells forth and carries everything
before it.
</p>
<p>
How many times have this or that old
person’s last days been made peaceful and
tranquil, instead of torn with anxiety, by the
hidden action of “a few friends”: (ah, the
fine and sweet reticence!); and these not persons
of means, but of slender purses; young
men, among others, with the new cares of
marriage and children already heavy upon
them.
</p>
<p>
Doctor’s bills “seen to”; a summer at the
seashore, for a drooping young mother,
“arranged for”; the new home cozily furnished,
and books and clothing found, for a
burnt-out household; a telephone installed, a
year at college provided for; a girl, not at
fault, but in trouble, taken in and made one
of the family; these instances and their like
crowd the town’s unwritten annals.
</p>
<p>
I must not seem to rate our dear Town too
highly, or to claim that these examples are
anything out of the common, that they shine
brighter than the countless other unseen stars
of the Milky Way of Kindness. I only stand
abashed before a bed-rock quality of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200'></a>200</span>
friendship, which never wears out nor tires; which
gives and gives again, gravely, yet not counting
the cost, and does not withhold that last
sharing of hearth and privacy, before which so
many dwellers in more sophisticated places
cannot but waver.
</p>
<p>
Have I given too many examples? How
can I withhold them!
</p>
<p>
I think of the machine-tender and his wife,
who, in a year of ill-health and doctor’s bills
for themselves and their two children, took in
the young wife of a fellow-worker who had
lost his position; tended her when her baby
came, cared for mother and child for eight
months, till a new job was found.
</p>
<p>
Of two households, who took in and made
happy, the one a broken-down artist who had
fallen on evil times in a great city, the other
a sour-tempered old working woman, left
without kin. The first household have growing-up
children, an automobile, horses, all
the complexities of well-to-do life in these
days, but the tie of old friendship was the
one thing considered. The householders in
the second case were not even near friends,
merely fellow church members, a kind man
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201'></a>201</span>
and wife, left without children, who could not
enjoy their warm house while old Hannah
was friendless. They tended her as they
might have tended their own sister.
</p>
<p>
Of the young teacher, alone in the world,
who, when calamity came to two married
friends (a burnt house and office, and desperate
illness) took <em>all</em> the savings that were
to have gone for three years’ special training,
went to them, a three-days’ railroad journey,
brought them home, and bore all the household
expenses of the young couple, and of their
baby’s coming, until new work was found.
</p>
<p>
The cooking and housework for four persons,
(together with a heavy amount of neighborhood
work,) would seem enough for even a
very capable and kind pair of hands. Well,
one friend, in addition to this, for two years
cooked and carried in <em>all</em> the meals for a neighbor
(a good many doors away), a crippled girl,
a prey, heretofore, to torturing dyspepsia.
There was no chance of saving the girl’s life,
she had a fatal complaint, but thanks to this
simple ministry, her last two years were free
from pain, and she was as happy a creature as
could well be.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202'></a>202</span>
</p>
<p>
These and like cases crowd to one’s mind,
till the memories of the town ring like a
chime of bells.
</p>
<p>
I remember how troubled we were about
one neighbor, a gentle, sweet lady, left the
last of a large and affectionate family circle;
how we dreaded the loneliness for her. We
need not have been troubled. There was a
place for her at every hearth in the neighborhood,
and when the long last illness set in,
kind, pitiful hands of neighbors were close
about, soothing and tending her. One
younger friend, like a daughter, never left
her, day after day. Her own people were
all gone before her, her harvest was gathered,
there could be no more anguish of parting;
and her last years seemed, as one might say,
carried forward on a sunny river of friendship.
</p>
<p>
III
</p>
<p>
People from sunnier climates speak sometimes
of our lack of community cheer and of
festivals; but a temperature of twenty below
zero—or even twenty above—does not conduce
to dancing on the green; and it may be that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203'></a>203</span>
the spirit’s light-footedness, like that of the
outward person, is hampered by many wrappings.
Yet once in a while even we northern
people do “break out”; as on Fourth of July,
when, in the early morning, the “Antiques
and Horribles,” masked and painted, ride,
grinning, through the streets.
</p>
<p>
After a football victory, our High School
boys, like boys everywhere, break out in unorganized
revel. They caper about in night-shirts
put on over their clothes, or in their
mother’s and sisters’ skirts, and with the
girls as well, they dance down the street in
a snake-dance. They light a bonfire in the
square, and sing, cheer, and frolic around it.
Though they do not know it, it is pure
carnival.
</p>
<p>
The long white months of winter see us all
very busy and settled. This is the time of
year when solid reading is done, and sheets
are hemmed, when our Literary Societies
write and read their papers, when we get up
plays and tableaux, and the best work is done
in the schools. Nobody minds the long
evenings, the lamplight beside the open fires
is so infinitely cozy; and on moonlight nights,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204'></a>204</span>
all winter, the long double-runners slip past
outside, with joyful laughter and clatter, as
the boys and girls—and their elders—take one
hill after another in the Mile Coast.
</p>
<p>
With the breaking-up of the ice, all our
settled order breaks up, too, in the tremendous
effort of Spring Cleaning. It is as
chaotic within the house as without. The
furniture is huddled in the middle of the
room, swathed in sheets. The master of the
house mourns and seeks, like a bird robbed
of its nest. We live in aprons and sweeping
caps, and in mock despair. The painter will
not come; the step-ladder is broken; the
spare-room matting is too worn to be put
down again; but every dimmest corner of the
attic, every picture and molding, every fragment
of put-away china, is shining and polished
before the weary wives will take rest.
</p>
<p>
With the first warm-scented May nights,
the children’s bedtime becomes an indefinite
hour. They are all out after dusk, like
flights of chimney-swallows. They run and
race down the streets, they don’t know why,
and frolic like moths about the electric-light
poles.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205'></a>205</span>
</p>
<p>
Memorial Day, with its grave celebration,
renews our citizenship. The children are in
the fields almost at sunrise, gathering scarlet
columbines in the hill crannies, yellow dog-tooth
violets, buttercups in the tall wet grass,
stripping their mothers’ gardens of their brilliant
blaze of tulips, bending down the heavy,
dewy heads of white and purple lilacs. The
matrons meet early at Grand Army Hall, and
tie up and trim bouquets and baskets busily
till noon. The talk is sober, but cheerful, and
there is a realization of harvest-home and
achievement, rather than sadness. The little
sacred procession marches past, to the sound
of music that is more elating than mournful.
Later, after the marching, the tired men find
hot coffee and sandwiches ready for them.
</p>
<p>
With summer, inconsequence and irresponsibility
steal happily over the town.
Even in the shops and factories the work is
not the same, for employers and employees
have become easy-going, and the business
streets look contentedly drowsy. Bricks
and paving stones cannot keep out the wafts
of summer fragrance, and with them an ease
and gayety, a <em>joie de vivre</em>, diffuse themselves,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206'></a>206</span>
which are astonishing after our winter soberness.
Our night-lunch carts, popcorn, and
pink lemonade booths, with their little flaring
lights, are ugly, if compared, for instance, to
kindred things in Italy, but they manifest the
same spirit. The coming of a circus shows
this feeling at its height, but it does not need
a circus to bring it out; and the Merry-go-round
on one of our wharves toots its gay
little whistle all summer. Music, sometimes
queer and naive in expression, comes stealing
out through the town. Our music is never
organized, but the strains of brass or string
quartettes or a small band, or of a little part
singing, are heard of an evening.
</p>
<p>
Everybody who can manage it goes down
to the sea, if but for one day, and the small
excursion steamer is crowded on her daily
trips to “The Islands.”
</p>
<p>
“It takes from trade,” remarks I. Scanlon,
the teamster, “but you’ve only got one life
to live. At a time!” he adds reverently;
and he and his wife and six children travel
down to a much-be-cottaged island, set up
their tent on the beach, and for a delicious,
barefoot fortnight live on fish of their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207'></a>207</span>
own catching, and potatoes brought with
them from home.
</p>
<p>
We almost live on our lawns, and neighbors
stray across to each other’s piazzas for
friendly talk, friendly silence, all through the
warm summer evenings.
</p>
<p>
By October every string needs tautening.
The still, keen weather takes matters into its
own hands, and we are brought back strictly
to work. Meetings are held, committees appointed,
plans made for the winter’s tasks,
and soon each group is hard at it, for this and
that missionary barrel, this and that campaign;
and at Thanksgiving the matrons meet
again at Grand Army Hall, to apportion and
send out the Thanksgiving Dinner. It is a
privilege to be with the kind, able women,
to watch their capable hands, their shortcuts
to the heart of the matter in question,
their easy authority, their large friendliness;
in more cases than not, their distinction of
bearing as well.
</p>
<p>
Thanksgiving once over, the pace quickens.
Each church has its yearly sale and supper
at hand, for which months of faithful work
have been preparing, and these once worked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208'></a>208</span>
off, the whole town, as I have said, loses its
head in a perfect fever of giving. What does
anything matter but happiness? Christmas
is coming! Every man, woman, and child is
a hurrying Santa Claus. The first snow
brings its strange hush, its strange sheltering
pureness, and the sleigh-bells begin once more
to jingle all about. During Christmas week
hundreds of strings of colored lights are
hung across the business streets. Wreaths
and garlands of fragrant balsam fir, the very
breath and expression of our countryside, are
hung everywhere, over shop windows and
doorways, in every house window, and on
quiet mounds in the churchyard and cemetery.
The solemnity of the great festival, which is
our Christmas, our All Saints’ and All Souls’
in one, folds round us.
</p>
<p>
The churches are all dark and sweet, like
rich nests, with their heavy fir garlands, lit
up by candles. Pews that may be scantily
filled at most times are crowded to-night,
for here are the boys and girls, thronging
home from business and college. Here are
the three tall boys of one household, whom
we have not seen for a long time, and there
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209'></a>209</span>
are four others. Here are girls home from
boarding-school, rosy and sweet, blossomed
into full maidenhood, bringing a whiff of the
city in their furs and well-cut frocks. There
is the only son of one family, who left home
a stripling, now back for the first time, a
stalwart man, with his young wife and three
children. His little mother cannot see plainly,
through her happy tears; and there, and there,
and there again, are re-united households.
</p>
<p>
The bells ring out, and after them comes
the silver sound of the first hymn.
</p>
<p>
Of late, on Christmas evening, the choirs
of the different churches have begun the
custom of meeting on the Common, to
lead the crowd in hymns, round the town
Christmas Tree. Later they separate and
go about singing to different invalids and
shut-ins, and many of the houses are
lighted up.
</p>
<div class='center'>
<p>“Silent Night! Holy Night!”</p>
</div>
<p>
So, within doors, we neighbors meet in reverent
and thankful worship; while without,
the pure snow, the grave trees, the stars, bear
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210'></a>210</span>
their enduring witness to that of which they,
and we and our human worship, are a part.
</p>
<p>
Peace and good-will to our town, where it
lies sheltered among its hills. The country
rises on each side of it, and stretches peacefully
away to east and west. The valleys
gather their waters, the wooded hills climb
to the stars; they wait, guarding in silent
bosoms the treasure of their memories, the
secret of their hopes.

<p>
TWO NOTABLE NATURE BOOKS.
</p>
<p>
FERNS
</p>
<p>
A Manual for the Northeastern States. By C. E. WATERS, Ph.D.
(Johns Hopkins). With Analytical Keys Based on the Stalks.
<em>With over 200 illustrations</em> from original drawings and photographs.
362 pp. Square 8vo. Boxed. <em>$3.00 net.</em> (By mail, $3.34.)
</p>
<p>
A popular, but thoroughly scientific book, including all the
ferns in the region covered by Britton’s Manual. Much information
is also given concerning reproduction and classification,
fern photography, etc.
</p>
<p>
PROF. L. M. UNDERWOOD, OF COLUMBIA:
</p>
<p>
“It is really more scientific than one would expect from
a work of a somewhat popular nature. The photographs are
very fine, very carefully selected and will add much to the
text. I do not see how they could be much finer.”
</p>
<p>
THE PLANT WORLD:
</p>
<p>
“This book is likely to prove the leading popular work
on ferns. The majority of the illustrations are from original
photographs; in respect to this feature, it can be confidently
asserted that <em>no finer examples of fern photography have ever
been produced</em>.... May be expected to prove of permanent
scientific value, as well as to satisfy a want which existing
treatises have but imperfectly filled.”
</p>
<p>
MUSHROOMS
</p>
<p>
Edible, Poisonous Mushrooms, etc. By Prof. GEO. F. ATKINSON,
of Cornell.
</p>
<p>
With recipes for cooking by Mrs. S. T. RORER, and
the chemistry and toxicology of mushrooms, by J. F.
CLARK. With 230 illustrations from photographs, including
fifteen colored plates. 320pp. 8vo. $3.00 net (by mail, $3.23).
</p>
<p>
Among the additions in this second edition are ten new plates,
chapters on the “Uses of Mushrooms,” and on the “Cultivation of
Mushrooms,” illustrated by several flashlight photographs.
</p>
<p>
EDUCATIONAL REVIEW:
</p>
<p>
“It would be difficult to conceive of a more attractive
and useful book, nor one that is destined to exert a greater
influence in the study of an important class of plants that
have been overlooked and avoided simply because of ignorance
of their qualities, and the want of a suitable book of
low price. In addition to its general attractiveness and the
beauty of its illustrations, it is written in a style well calculated
to win the merest tyro or the most accomplished student
of the fungi.... These clear photographs and the
plain descriptions make the book especially valuable for the
amateur fungus hunter in picking out the edible from the
poisonous species of the most common kinds.”
</p>
<p>
THE PLANT WORLD:
</p>
<p>
“This is, without doubt, the most important and valuable
work of its kind that has appeared in this country in recent
years.... No student, either amateur or professional, can
afford to be without it.”

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
